Former beauty queen Torres and Anthony had been married just three years and had two young boys together when Anthony left her for Lopez. (They had separated prior to that but had renewed their vows afterwards.) Anthony secured a quickie divorce in the Dominican Republic in 2004 and then married Lopez. Torres hasn’t confirmed whether or not Anthony cheated on her with Lopez, as was widely assumed, but she did explain how his leaving affected her, and how she was so shocked and devastated that <a href=#>she stayed in bed for days</a> afterwards. So in a roundabout way Torres sort-of claimed that she was not separated from Anthony when he took up with Lopez.</p><p>That was nearly ten years ago, and Anthony has of course inevitably filed for divorce from Jennifer Lopez. That divorce is not finalized yet and it’s been about a year and a half since Anthony filed. (He now <a href=#>has a 21 year-old British girlfriend</a>, Topshop heiress Chloe Green.) In the mean time, Torres wants her child support raised from $13,000 a month to $113,000 a month. TMZ reports that she’s living in a small apartment and can’t afford to make ends meet:</p><p>Marc Anthony’s ex-wife claims the singer has turned a cold shoulder on her children … forcing them to sell their home and move into a hovel in the Valley … while he lives like a king.</p><p>Dayanara Torres — the 1993 Miss Universe — wants a huge increase in child support — from $13K per month for their 2 sons, to $113K a month. It’s an enormous increase, but she says it’s a drop in the bucket for Marc — who this year boasted he makes $1.25 mil a month — MINIMUM.</p><p>It’s especially infuriating for Dayanara, who claims Marc played the poverty card during their divorce, claiming he had such money trouble he had to sell his private island and let some of his staff go. Now get this … the week the divorce became final, she says he bought JLo a $4 MILLION RING!</p><p>Dayanara says Marc goes weeks and even months without seeing their boys, one of whom has special needs. She mentions one instance where he told the boys he couldn’t visit because of work, but then they saw him on TV cavorting on a beach with JLo. They were devastated.</p><p>Dayanara gives Marc backhanded credit for giving the kids lavish gifts. For example, last XMAS he sent them 4 huge boxes of toys, including an extravagant Lego set. But she says their apartment is so small they have no space to play with them.</p><p>She also grouses that Marc actually PAYS JLO child support, and a lot of it — way more than she gets.</p><p><a href=#>[From TMZ]</a></p><p>I don’t understand how someone is unable to live on $156,000 a year. Of course Anthony should pay more support to his kids given his wealth, but at the same time I don’t get how someone making over six figures has to live in a small apartment. I live in the country now though, it’s expensive to have a home in populated areas and from what I understand California is especially pricey. Also, J.Lo gets child support?! Her estimated net worth is $250 million dollars.</p><p>This reminds me of the recent story of Jon Cryer’s ex wife wanting her child support, for their 13 year-old son, <a href=#>increased from $8k a month to $89k a month</a>. Cryer’s son goes to an exclusive private school, where his mom’s measly $96k a year in child support is chump change.</p><p>It does seem supremely unfair that Lopez, with her massive earnings and bought and paid-for lover, gets more child support from Anthony than his first wife. More than that he doesn’t seem to care about his kids from that marriage, which is just sad for them.</p><p><a href=#><img alt=wenn20884716 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/wenn20884716-682x1024.jpg width=500 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img alt=wenn20434119 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/wenn20434119-644x1024.jpg width=500 sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img alt=wenn20729322 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/wenn20729322-726x1024.jpg width=500 sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photo credit: WENN.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbGtmaoB6e8yaqZyXkaPBqbvNsqqYnaiUxKK606yWoZ2ilLCptcudlqytoKW8s8C%2Bq5iiq5WZrKe%2BzqaWamublMGwq5BqaqSXkZS6sLrToWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mookie-wilson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mookie Wilson Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./johnny-lee-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Johnny Lee Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
