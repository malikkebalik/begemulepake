In 2002, he spoke with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Television Academy Foundation</a> about his career in television and ardently denied the existence of Columbo’s first name.</p><p id=par-5_40>Link, who died in 2020, said: “Never had a [first name] and never will. [Columbo] never had one. We tried that with [1960s and ’70s detective series] Mannix. Because it becomes like a signature thing and people talk about it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_15>Link remarked on a tabletop trivia game that claimed to know the detective’s first name.</p><p id=par-7_62>“There was that Canadian board game that everybody was playing a while back,” he recalled. “And there was the question: ‘What is Peter Falk’s first name?,’ and the answer was ‘Philip.’ Wrong. Columbo never had a first name. You’ll never hear a first name just like you’ll never see Columbo’s wife. Ever. Peter was very adamant about that, and so were we.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-lawsuit-that-said-columbo-did-indeed-have-a-given-name>The lawsuit that said Columbo did indeed have a given name</h2><p id=par-8_40>The story, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Columbo blog Columbophile</a>, begins with accomplished trivia book author Fred L.
