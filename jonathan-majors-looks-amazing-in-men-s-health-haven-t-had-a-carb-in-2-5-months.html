He started getting credits ˜2017 and his career has really picked up recently, with him appearing in buzzy projects like&nbsp;The Last Black Man in San Francisco,&nbsp;Lovecraft Country, Da 5 Bloods, the upcoming&nbsp;Antman/Avengers movies, and&nbsp;Creed III.&nbsp;Currently, he’s making the promotional rounds for&nbsp;Devotion&nbsp;and as such appeared on the cover of&nbsp;Men’s Health looking (how do I put this)&nbsp;FOINE.&nbsp;The man does his own stunts for his action movies and is in amazing shape.</p><p>Jonathan Majors is showing off his muscles on the cover of Men’s Health magazine.</p><p>The 33-year-old actor hit the pool in a red bathing suit for the lead image to the publication. Other pics from the shoot see him shirtless in the kitchen cooking up breakfast and juggling oranges, cuddling with a dog and hanging upside down.</p><p>Inside the magazine, Jonathan opened up about a variety of topics including joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe, his body and love.</p><p><strong>On doing his own stunts and convincing the audience that his characters are real:</strong> “People have been following this character for two hours sometimes. I’ve been trying so hard to tell the truth, which is not easy. A part of you will know. That’s Kang, but that’s not my Kang. That’s Kang adjacent. That’s a stunt guy. In The Harder They Fall, I ride a horse in a very particular way. You put a stunty on that, and they go, ‘He don’t got the swag. His head ain’t bopping.’ You should never once think it’s not him. You know it’s him. So you trust in him.”</p><p>O<strong>n what drew him to the role of Kang, which he will take on in Avengers:</strong> The Kang Dynasty slated for release in 2025: “It was the character and dimensions of Kang. And the potential that it had. I thought, I’ll take a chance on that. Killmonger, Thanos, and Kang are not related, and that’s good for the MCU. It adds diversity.”</p><p><strong>On resisting the temptation to overdo it when physical transformation is part of the job — especially when playing a chiseled superhero:</strong> “I look at Kang and I go, Okay, cool. It’s a certain IP where people expect this at a bare minimum. No one should put themselves or their families in a place where they’re hurting, but your own discomfort is not necessarily a bad thing. That’s growth. It’s not comfortable, but you’re here to save the world, aren’t you? Or take over the world.”</p><p><strong>On finding romance in his work:</strong> “It’s an occupation. It actually is what occupies my mind all the time, outside of my intimate relationships. I’m lucky in that way. I just really like it. Some days it is a job. But that’s the athlete in me, where it’s like, Okay, that’s another rep; it’s the last round. There’s something romantic about that. You get off work at 4:30 in the morning, drive home in Los Angeles through Topanga Canyon, and nobody’s on the road. I bring my dogs to work. So I got my dogs in the truck. I got my windows down. Got my Radiohead playing. I’m just gunning it. That’s the best, man.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>Men’s Health</a> via <a href=#>JustJared</a>]</p><p>So it seems like Jonathan played one character in Loki, but is appearing as another — Kang the Conqueror — in Antman and the Avengers movies. Interesting. I’m no Marvel expert, but has anyone else pulled double duty like this? I like what he says about the differences in the MCU’s various villains. They are pretty different across the various films/franchises and it keeps the stories from feeling rote. I’m interested to see what he brings to Kang. The sense I get from the interview is he’s maybe method, but not in the annoying way where he torments others. He’s super dedicated and wants to bring as much realism to his roles as possible. That’s clear from what he says about doing his own stunts. That’s clear from what he says about his intensive physical training. And it’s also clear from what he says about weights! Dude does all his takes of lifting weights with real weights?! And we get to enjoy the results in these lovely pictures.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>If Majors built his body to tell a story, then these never-before-seen photos are worth a thousand words. <a href=#>https://t.co/SUqAkEPhgO</a></p><p>— Men's Health Mag (@MensHealthMag) <a href=#>October 13, 2022</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This big back-building routine helped Majors achieve his newly-jacked physique. <a href=#>https://t.co/KiOBzNGonG</a></p><p>— Men's Health Mag (@MensHealthMag) <a href=#>October 13, 2022</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcHBoZ4J3e8mopZqsmJa7oLnAo6arq4%2BhvLC30piYppmqnruoq8inlqadnqisqbHApauhl5iWw6a605ifmpyPlqykrdGblqKmj2eCoLnOp6uhq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kiss-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kiss Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-old-is-gibby-s-brother-guppy-gibson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Old Is Gibby's Brother, Guppy Gibson?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
