He called 2022 the “darkest, worst year” of his life as the reality TV star struggled with confidence. According to Tyler, he identified his inability to “be myself” as the “nail in the coffin” to his four-year relationship and engagement to Angela.</p><h2><strong>Angela previously confirmed the breakup with Tyler</strong></h2><p id=par-6_25>Although the&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;alum referred to their breakup as a “dark time,” he admitted he’s grateful for it as it helped him confront his past traumas.</p><p id=par-7_22>Tyler says he’s begun focusing on his mental health and has since realized the demand to elevate himself resulted in his depression.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-8_30>The Hilton Head native still lives in the South Carolina home he owns with Angela and isn’t sure about his next moves as he’s focused on maintaining a positive mindset.</p><p id=par-9_57>Tangela fans began believing their favorite reality TV couple secretly split up around the summer of 2022 when they noticed the usually affectionate pair stopped posting pictures with each other on social media. They remained silent about the alleged split until late January 2023, when <a href=#>Angela confirmed their breakup</a> in a YouTube video on their rebranded channel.</p><h2><strong>Angela says they officially split in August 2022</strong></h2><p id=par-10_40>According to the&nbsp;BB20&nbsp;star, the couple began having issues in mid-2021, a few months after they got engaged. She admitted to competing in CBS’s spinoff series&nbsp;<a href=#>The Challenge: USA,</a> which she filmed in April 2022, hoping the break would help their relationship.</p><p id=par-11_49>However, Angela noted their bond continued to deteriorate, resulting in their decision to attend therapy. Ultimately, it didn’t work, as Angela said the couple chose to split in August 2022. She explained she went to Bali and began a healing journey while he remained in their South Carolina-based home.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_62>According to Angela, the couple had a video chat planned alongside her therapist for a few months later, in December 2022, where they would discuss the future of their relationship. However, an article was published a day before their anticipated conversation revealing their split, causing Angela to feel “silenced.” Therefore, she withdrew as she didn’t want to face questions at the time.</p><p id=par-13_82>The Challenge&nbsp;finalist went on to clarify that she and Tyler have broken up but plan to keep their house and jewelry business together. Additionally, she claimed she has since opened a business in Bali and intends to acquire a two-year residency in the country. While Angela said she might open up more about their breakup at a later date and claimed she’ll always love him, Tyler didn’t say anything about her, and it doesn’t seem as though he’ll address their split again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvqrOMm6morJiav27A2KWcq2WTp7a0vMSnZJ6mlJqxbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2aYp5%2BVoa5uvtSmpJqmo2O1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./frank-converse-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Frank Converse Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./john-deere-6145r-tractor-price-specs-review-features-2022.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>John Deere 6145R Tractor Price, Specs, Review &amp;amp; Features 2022</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
