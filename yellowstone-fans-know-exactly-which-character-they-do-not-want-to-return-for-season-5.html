The story of fifth-generation rancher John Dutton (<a href=#>Kevin Costner</a>) and his fight to protect his family’s land will continue this fall when Yellowstone returns for season 5. However, there’s one character that fans have no interest in seeing again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jimmy Hurdstrom had a major storyline in ‘Yellowstone’ season 4</h2><p id=par-3_48>While the majority of Yellowstone season 4 focused on John Dutton and his family, ranch hand Jimmy Hurdstrom (<a href=#>Jefferson White</a>) also had a major storyline. He started the season lying prone in a corral after being bucked off a horse. And it wasn’t clear if he had survived.</p><p id=par-4_50>Luckily, he did. But Jimmy’s accident was the result of him ignoring John’s instructions to stay away from the rodeo. After months of rehab and recovery with his girlfriend Mia by his side, John sent Jimmy to the <a href=#>Four Sixes Ranch</a> in Texas to learn how to become a cowboy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_30>When Jimmy left the Yellowstone Ranch and headed to the Lone Star state, he left Mia behind. And, he didn’t give her any guarantees about the future of their relationship.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jimmy found a new love interest at the Four Sixes Ranch</h2><p id=par-6_70>Not only did Jimmy become a real cowboy in Texas, he also fell in love. Toward the end of the season, Jimmy met Emily (Kathryn Kelly) and they quickly connected. As a vet tech for the 6666, Emily has a messy job of collecting horse semen. The ice was broken between her and Jimmy when she enlisted him to help her “collect” a stallion’s contribution to the ranch’s research lab.</p><p id=par-7_29>Emily forced Jimmy to apply a sheath to the horse’s penis to retrieve the specimen. Then, she immediately asked him out to dinner, explaining why he caught her eye.</p><p id=par-8_31>“Look, you’re one of six single guys in this county under 30,” Emily told him. “Thought I’d go on and make my move before you go and get all scooped up.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Yellowstone’ fans don’t want to see this character in season 5</h2><p id=par-9_64>Fans saw Jimmy and Emily hook up in Season 4, Episode 7 “Keep the Wolves Close.” But they were shocked in the season finale when Jimmy arrived back at the Yellowstone with his new fiancée by his side. Mia was hanging out at the ranch. And when she saw that Jimmy had moved on, the barrel racer quickly greeted her ex with a punch.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_63>After Jimmy and Mia duked it out verbally, she told him to choose between her and Emily once and for all. Jimmy quickly made his choice. He and Emily loaded up their truck and headed back to Texas to start their new life together. And it looks like there’s a good chance their relationship will be part of the new Yellowstone spinoff 6666.</p><p id=par-11_25>As for Mia, fans have decided that they don’t want to see her anymore in the Yellowstone universe. Not in Yellowstone proper, or its spinoff.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Eden Brolin comes from a star-studded family</h2><p id=par-12_53>The role of Mia is played by Eden Brolin, the daughter of <a href=#>Marvel star Josh Brolin</a>, The Goonies alum and Yellowstone creator <a href=#>Taylor Sheridan</a> worked together in 2015’s Sicario. But Eden’s dad Josh isn’t the only big name in the family. Her grandfather is actor James Brolin, and her step-grandmother is Barbra Streisand.</p><p id=par-13_25>In addition to working on Yellowstone, Eden Brolin played Charlie in the sci-fi television series Beyond. She also starred in the 2020 neo-noir film Arkansas.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-some-yellowstone-fans-think-mia-is-annoying>Some ‘Yellowstone’ fans think Mia is ‘annoying’</h2><p id=par-14_50>Despite Brolin’s acting pedigree — and her loyalty to Jimmy — Yellowstone fans are ready for Mia to go. In a Yellowstone Reddit thread, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous fans</a> voiced their opinion about the Jimmy/Mia/Emily love triangle. And the majority made it clear who they wanted to see together — Jimmy and Emily.</p><p id=par-15_16>“Mia was so annoying. Hopefully this means they write out her character,” one unhappy fan wrote.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-16_33>Others thought that Mia’s time on Yellowstone was over, but they were sure she would show up again on the spinoff 6666. “I get the feeling she’s headed to Texas,” another fan shared.</p><p id=par-17_18>Fans will find out if Mia returns when <a href=#>Yellowstone season 5</a> premieres this fall on the Paramount Network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTGprjLqK6srJ%2Bjsm6ywKeqZqOepMRusdeamq2kqWLEqbXCoWScoJGnrqTAxKtkraCVrnqlu4ynpq1lp5a7tXnTqGSrnaSqv695xaipZquVlsCwuoxuZaGsnaF8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./barbra-streisand-gets-some-plastic-surgery.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Barbra Streisand gets some plastic surgery</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-circle-auditions-are-similar-to-a-job-interview-according-to-1-contestant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'The Circle' Auditions Are Similar to a 'Job Interview', According to 1 Contestant</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
