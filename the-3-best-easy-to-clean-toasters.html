Some toasters come with only hinged bottoms, but those designs cannot be washed in the sink, and the whole toaster must be carried to the trash can in order to empty it. You'll also want to pick a toaster with a stainless steel or plastic exterior. Both of these materials can usually be wiped clean with a damp cloth, or washed with common household items like vinegar or dish soap. Stainless steel is more durable than plastic, but plastic is usually cheaper and comes in a wider array of colors.</p><p>To clean your toaster, it's good idea to empty the crumb tray every week or so, and the outside should be wiped down whenever it looks dirty. If you really want to scrub your toaster, you can use a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>bottle brush or compressed air</a> to get at stubborn crumbs on the inside, but make sure to always unplug it first.</p><p>Now, just because you're looking for <a href=# class=T3D>an easy-to-clean toaster</a> doesn't mean you don't want a toaster that, well, toasts. When picking a toaster, look for one that includes any pre-programmed settings you may use, such as reheat, frozen, and bagel. If you do plan to toast bagels, you'll also want to make sure the slots are wide enough to fit them. (Nobody wants to start their day with a bagel that's had all of its poppy seeds rubbed off.) Finally, you'll want to consider the number of settings. Some brands refer to them as "speed settings" while others call them "browning settings," but they all work the same way.</p><p>If you're ready to get toasting, check out this list of the best easy-to-clean toasters.</p><h2>1. The Easy-To-Use Toaster With A Classic Look</h2><p>Simple and sleek, this <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>classic Cuisinart toaste</a>r is easy to clean and easy to use. The outside is made of stainless steel, so you can wipe it down as needed, and the slide out crumb tray is fully removable. This toaster comes with bagel, defrost, and reheat settings, as well as a cancel button, and the slots are wide enough to fit bagels. The browning level of your toast can be controlled with the six-setting knob, and there's a classic spring-loaded design to pop your toast up when it's done. If you need to make more than two slices on a regular bass, consider the brand's <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>four-slice design</a>.</p><p><strong>One fan raved </strong>“This is my second Cuisinart toaster. My first one lasted over 12 years and had the same features as my new one. What I especially like about the Cuisinart is the slide out tray under the toaster that collects the crumbs which makes for easy cleaning. I also use my liquid air duster to blow out any loose crumbs that did not fall on the tray. Would recommend this product.”</p><h2>2. A Colorful, Glass-Sided Toaster With Over 5,000 Fans</h2><p>Get your toast just how you like it, every time, with this <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>glass-sided Dash toaster</a>. Simply put your bread in the 1.5-inch wide slot, turn the dial to one of the seven browning levels, then wait and watch until your toast is perfectly crisp. This toaster also features preset defrost, bagel, and reheat settings. More than just a great design, this toaster is a breeze to clean as both the interior glass panel and crumb tray are fully removable, and the plastic exterior can be easily wiped down. It has a sleek, retro-inspired design, and comes in a variety of fun colors.</p><p><strong>One fan raved </strong>“I love this toaster. It looks nice sitting out and doesn't take up a lot of space because it is very thin. I like that the inner glass can be removed and cleaned. I got the white one and it looks really nice. It heats evenly. Worth the money!”</p><ul><li>Available colors: aqua, white, red, gray, and black</li></ul><h2>3. A High-End Toaster That’s Built To Last</h2><p>‌</p><p>Made by Wolf, a top luxury kitchen appliance brand, this <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>deluxe four-slot toaster</a> is made from aluminum with a stainless steel exterior. It can toast four slices at a time, and if you're making toast for a picky group, you can set each side to different browning levels. It features commercial heating elements for professional-grade toast, and has bagel, keep warm, and frozen settings. The extra-wide slots have self-centering guides, so thin bread won't lean to one side, but you can still toast bagels or thick sourdough. The sleek knob controls the seven browning settings, and fans are obsessed with the "keep warm" setting that helps your toast remain perfectly crisp while you finish cooking the rest of breakfast. The crumb tray slides out for effortless cleaning, and the durable stainless steel exterior can be wiped down with a damp rag. This toaster also comes with a limited five-year warranty.</p><p><strong>One fan raved </strong>“My husband bought this toaster to match his Wolf Range Oven. My youngest son and I teased him over buying a $400 toaster. My son was the first to test drive the Wolf Toaster and could not believe how good the toast tasted. The bread gets evenly toasted and does taste way better. Trust me, I know you are thinking, “It’s a toaster,” but if you have the extra $400 this product is well worth it !!!"</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC4yJ%2BcaJqVqMFuscCssGasn2KwrbHAp2Stp5Gowaa%2B0g%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-versatile-gifts-your-gemini-bestie-will-love.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Versatile Gifts Your Gemini Bestie Will Love</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stephen-colletti-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-girlfriend-family-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stephen Colletti Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
