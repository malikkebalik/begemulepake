Son Peter married Jack Lemmon's daughter <a href=#>Courtney Lemmon</a> on March 24, 2001. Both Jody, David and their families reside in New Mexico. Frances passed away in Connecticut where she was staying with son Peter.</p><p>The nonagenarian actress was a huge hit at the 1998 Memphis Film Festival in Tunica, Mississippi.</p><p>In 1995, she donated 220 acres of her Thousand Oaks (CA) ranch to the Conejo Recreation and Park District to be preserved as parkland. In 1981, she and husband <a href=#>Joel McCrea</a> had given 75 acres to the District.</p><p>She was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7080 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on February 1, 1994.</p><p>Their 57-year marriage ended in 1990, when McCrea died.

Selznick as being too similar in beauty to Vivien Leigh to play the role. Olivia de Havilland was then given the role.</p><p>In 1935, she and husband <a href=#>Joel McCrea</a> separated, but soon reconciled. In 1966, he filed for divorce, charging her with cruelty; however, the couple stayed married until his death.</p><p>Met future husband <a href=#>Joel McCrea</a> on the set of The Silver Cord (1933).

She and McCrea began dating after the movie was completed and her romance with Linden was over. It was her relationship with McCrea that compelled her to sign with RKO Pictures.</p><p>After her breakthrough role in Playboy of Paris (1930) opposite Maurice Chevalier, she met <a href=#>Joel McCrea</a> on the set of the 1933 film The Silver Cord (1933). Following a whirlwind courtship, the two were married later that year in Rye, New York.</p><p>Dee was born in Los Angeles, where her Army officer father was stationed, and grew up in Chicago after her father was transferred there. In 1929, he was re-assigned to L. A. , and, as a lark, the 19 year old Dee began working in motion pictures as an extra.</p><p>Her debut was in Words and Music (1929) with <a href=#>Lois Moran</a>.</p><p>Born in Los Angeles, she and older sister Margaret (born 1908) moved when she was quite young to Cincinnati (OH), then to Washington (DC) before finally settling in the Hyde Park area of Chicago, where the sisters attended Shakespeare Grammar School.</p><p>Many sources misreported Dee's year of birth as 1907.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfm7%2BiusKeqmaclZo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./francisco-oropeza-age-how-old-is-the-texas-mass-shooter-case-update.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Francisco Oropeza Age: How Old Is the Texas Mass Shooter?
