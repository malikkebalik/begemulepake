I don’t intend to argue it wasn’t entertaining, as all <strong>Archer</strong> episodes are, just that it felt off, comparatively speaking, for a number of reasons.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=839 data-injectable=true>This was clear from the jump, with Archer mouthing his catch-phrase twice in the span of a minute and not even bothering to set it up beforehand. Did the writers go to work in a “danger zone,” only to say “wait, I had something for this,” and then proceed to give up altogether on contextualizing it? It was cute the first time to see him so desperate to say it, but the second time made it sound as if they were no longer trying.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Shortly thereafter, Captain Murphy re-enters the fold and my suspicions that he would drag the episode down proved true. Archer is a show accustomed to portraying characters in the throes of insanity, yet whereas usually they’re as lovably eccentric as the other “saner” characters, Murphy is half-baked and dull.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>He talks to himself, talks like a cliched environmentalist, tosses in yet another twist (there are no missiles), escalates the plot, and is then killed off, his usefulness exhausted. In short, he was a forgettable plot device used to bring about season four’s penultimate “twist,” so to speak, that Lana is pregnant and not by way of Cyril.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Did this have anything to do with the unspecified decision she was contemplating in an earlier episode? Was she mulling over how to handle her present predicament with regards to Archer and Cyril? I hate to think the writers would tack this on the end without any kind of foreshadowing, so I’ll go on believing they were hinting at it back then until proven otherwise.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>It wasn’t only her big reveal that I took issue with, however, but what it brought about as well. Archer selflessly giving Lana the last scuba suit and choosing to be the one to risk death sans suit was admittedly as heartwarming as Archer is ever bound to get. That’s not what bothered me.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>No, I was put off by it turning Cyril into a cut-rate Archer clone whose quips were to me not so much humorous as they were overly bitter. Cyril has every right to resent Lana for this, but I was waiting and hoping for her to have another largely hormone-driven freak-out on him like she had earlier on Archer. Except it never came (phrasing!).</p><p data-characters=589 data-current-count=933 data-injectable=true>It was all rather unclimactic, I have to say. The missiles turn out to be an insanity-inspired hoax. Barry’s pursuit of Archer is forgotten entirely, as is Archer’s personal journey involving the identity of his real father. Lana is pregnant out of nowhere and all we get out of it is Cyril being more of a douche than I thought possible. Cheryl and her brother Cecil make up because… Pam confides in Cheryl about her own sibling troubles? And the sea lab being obliterated is actually a win for him due to the absurdly large insurance payout he’s about to receive.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Lastly, Ray is once again confined to a wheel chair after barely getting any use out of those bionic legs of his. Here I was thinking they meant we’d see a cyborg battle, him versus Barry. The joke was on us, as he got about as much use out of those legs as he did his old ones. He could always go back under Krieger’s knife and we could still get that showdown, but I’m no longer counting on it.</p><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>All I’m looking forward to in season five is Archer making up for this, their first true misstep. Oh, it had its moments, such as Malory showing how alike she and her son are when downing that ethanol or Krieger drugged and drumming whilst modifying firearms, and I was entertained more or less throughout. That being said, it also left me asking “that’s it?” when the episode finally ended, which is the first (and I hope last) time that’s ever happened for me with <strong>Archer</strong>.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>The show has had its off episodes before, and it’s managed to come back strong each time, so I’ll predict (and hope) they do it again and I look forward to the start of season five already.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yivsKhnKtlo5qutLvNZp2ippGhsm6%2BxK%2Bgnq9dqLKiedOupa1loJa%2FtXmRZqqemaOku26AjJ6noqufmbJufZJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./did-jill-duggar-s-husband-derick-dillard-get-jaw-surgery-just-to-please-the-duggar-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Jill Duggar's Husband, Derick Dillard, Get Jaw Surgery Just to Please the Duggar Family?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-pineapple-fund-the-anonymous-wealthy-bitcoin-millionaire-who-s-pledged-to-give-away-millions.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Pineapple Fund: The Anonymous Wealthy Bitcoin Millionaire Who's Pledged To Give Away Millions</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
