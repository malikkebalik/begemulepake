Someone came in to fill her role during her second maternity leave, and that was <a href=#>Cathy Simms</a> (Lindsey Broad). But what happened to the controversial character?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cathy-simms-was-pam-halpert-s-replacement-on-the-office>Cathy Simms was Pam Halpert’s replacement on ‘The Office’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_22>Pam goes on maternity leave in season 8. Cathy is then introduced in the episode “Pam’s Replacement” to be her temporary replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_35>Multiple people in the office note that Cathy is attractive and compare her to Pam. This sadly makes Pam insecure, and she even asks Jim Halpert (<a href=#>John Krasinski</a>) if he finds the new girl attractive.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_53>Cathy does develop a crush on Jim. She flirts with him during a work trip in Florida in “After Hours.” She goes as far as to show up at his hotel room out of her more professional clothes. Obviously, she’s trying to seduce him, so Jim tries to find a way to escape.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happened-to-cathy-simms-on-the-office>What happened to Cathy Simms on ‘The Office’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Office-Stanley-Creed-Phyllis-Cathy.jpg><p id=par-5_43>The last time fans see Cathy is in the episode, “Last Day in Florida.” She tries to get Jim’s attention one more time, but he ignores her. She’s last seen in a meeting where Robert California (<a href=#>James Spader</a>) fires Todd Packer (David Koechner).&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_48>Sadly, Cathy is never given a proper send-off on the show after this. Her position at Dunder Mifflin was always supposed to be temporary, and Pam is seen back at work later in the season. It’s possible Cathy’s time at the paper company naturally came to its end.</p><p id=par-7_19>Broad moved on to other roles. She played Lisa in 21 Jump Street and appeared in small TV roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lindsey-broad-still-gets-hate-from-the-office-fans>Lindsey Broad still gets hate from ‘The Office’ fans</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_39>There is still a theory that Jim did cheat on Pam with Cathy. Some fans hate Cathy even if they believe nothing else happened between them. Broad sadly revealed what kind of comments she gets from fans in 2020.</p><p id=par-9_53>“If anyone is wondering what it was like to be on The Office, the best comedy of this century: I just posted something on Instagram about how my dog was murdered and a bunch of people were like ‘F*ck you, Cathy, she deserved it!’ So. There ya go!” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Broad tweeted</a> on Aug. 7.</p><p id=par-10_16>Broad more recently played Chelsea on In the Dark. She’s also in the 2021 movie, Trust.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_38>This wouldn’t be the last time Jim and Pam’s relationship would be tested. But in the end, Pam and Jim were still a happily married couple with two children, and Cathy was never heard from or mentioned again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMqJ2foZOaeri0wK1koZmgpbKvscNmmpqsmK56tLXMpqpnoKSiuXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-miles-teller-s-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Miles Teller's Net Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./monica-humphries-business-insider.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Monica Humphries - Business Insider</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
