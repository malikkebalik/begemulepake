Brandon Blackstock is probably best-known for being married to singer <a title="Kelly Clarkson Net Worth" href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a>. They married in 2013 and had two children together. Brandon also has two children from a previous relationship. As we detail later in this article, during their divorce process, at one point Brandon requested to be paid $436,000 per month in spousal and child support. When it was all said and done, Kelly agreed to pay him $45,000 per month in child support until their children turn 18 and $115,000 per month in spousal support for two years, ending in January 2024. Finally, she paid him $1.2 million to cover his legal expenses.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Brandon Blackstock was born in Fort Worth, Texas in December 1976. Brandon is the stepson of singer <a href=#>Reba McEntire</a> and his father, <a href=#>Narvel Blackstock</a>, is Clarkson's manager. Narvel was married to Reba for 26 years, from 1989 to 2015. Narvel and Reba had one child together. Soon after marrying, Narvel and Reba formed a corporation called Starstruck Entertainment that managed all aspects of Reba's career. When they divorced Narvel reportedly received a large percentage of Reba's wealth, which was considered communal property.</p><p>Brandon Blackstock and Kelly Clarkson were engaged in 2012 and married in 2013. When they met, Blackstock was technically still married to Melissa Ashworth. Brandon and Melissa's divorce was finalized in 2012. Brandon and Melissa had two children together. Together, Kelly and Brandon have a daughter and a son together.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-301799 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bb.jpg alt="Brandon Blackstock" width=611 height=431 sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-301799 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=real-estate>Real Estate</h2><p>During their marriage Brandon and Kelly resided in an $8 million mansion in Encino, California. In June 2018, Kelly bought the 10,000-square-foot mansion in Encino, California that became the family's primary residence. They had previously been renting an LA home that had been burglarized a number of times. Kelly listed the Encino home for sale in May 2020 for a tad under $10 million. The price was reduced to $9 million and then finally $8.24 million when it finally sold in September 2021. Here's a video tour of that house:</p><p></p><p>They also owned a home in Nashville, Tennessee and a ranch in Montana. Kelly maintained ownership of the ranch after the divorce. Brandon was ultimately awarded a 5% stake. At the time of that 5% award, the ranch was valued at $17 million.</p><h2 id=divorce-settlement><strong>Divorce Settlement</strong></h2><p>Kelly filed for divorce in June 2020. In December 2020, Brandon filed paperwork in which he requested $436,000 PER MONTH in spousal support. He broke the request down as $135,000 in child support and $301,000 in spousal support. He also requested a one-time $2 million payment to cover legal expenses. Brandon also asserted that he wanted their two children to live with him in Montana.</p><p>A judge eventually ordered Kelly to pay Brandon $45,000 per month in child support, presumably until their kids are 18. She was also ordered to pay $115,000 per month in spousal support for two years ending in January 2024. Finally, he was awarded $1.2 million for legal fees as a one-time payment.</p><h2 id=management-fee-lawsuit><strong>Management Fee Lawsuit</strong></h2><p>As they were battling it out over spousal support, Kelly filed legal documents with the California Labor Commission in which she claimed Brandon defrauded her during the 13 years he served as her manager. She also asserted that Brandon was not licensed to operate as a talent agent â€“ because talent agents in California must be licensed. A spokesperson for Brandon's company, Starstruck Management Group, countered by pointing out that during that period Kelly was always properly represented by her separate talent agency CAA. Two months earlier Starstruck sued Kelly for $1.4 million in owed commissions.</p><p>In November 2023 an LA judge sided with Kelly. The judge agreed that Brandon had overcharged Kelly by millions of dollars when representing her as her manager. Specifically, the ruling showed that Brandon overcharged on deals he inked for Kelly to appear on "The Voice," and in commercials for Wayfair and Norwegian Cruise Line.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97z6umna2Tmr%2B0e8GrmKecn6N6o7jAnKKsrJ%2BYuG66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chad-wild-clay-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-girlfriend-family-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chad Wild Clay Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-levine-jokes-he-s-looking-and-feeling-better-since-turning-40-i-m-benjamin-button-ing.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title></p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
