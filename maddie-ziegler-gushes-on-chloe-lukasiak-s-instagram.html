The original dancers: Nia Sioux, Chloé Lukasiak, <a href=#>Maddie Ziegler</a>, Mackenzie Ziegler, <a href=#>Paige Hyland</a>, and Brooke Hyland, in particular, have a very loyal following. Considering the six girls were all close friends growing up, fans are constantly speculating about the status of their friendship today. Fans are particularly interested in knowing if Maddie and Chloé are still friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dance-Moms-Season-2-cast.jpg><p id=par-2_65>Fans of Dance Moms will recall that Maddie and Chloé had a very close friendship in the first few seasons of the show. The pair knew each other years before the show started filming and were frequently duet partners. Their duets like Black Swan and We’re Alright quickly became fan favorites because the duo had a knack for dancing in sync with one another.</p><h2 id=h-dance-moms-cast-members-were-constantly-pitted-against-each-other>‘Dance Moms’ cast members were constantly pitted against each other</h2><p id=par-3_85>Unfortunately, filming Dance Moms wasn’t always easy on Maddie and Chloé’s friendship. The two were constantly pitted against one another because they were consistently two of the strongest dancers on the team. It didn’t help matters that their teacher, <a href=#>Abby Lee Miller</a>, seemed to fan the flames of their rivalry, once even assigning them the same solo and forcing their teammates to vote on which one was better. Furthermore, the reality show also loved to push the rivalry for the sake of the storyline.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_75>But despite the damage that Dance Moms likely caused, Chloé and Maddie seem to be on good terms today. Both dancers are now living in Los Angeles and pursuing careers in acting. They even hang out from time to time. In November of 2020, Paige and Brooke were asked if they still hung out with their former castmates and the sisters revealed that a bunch of them were coming over for a girls’ night.</p><h2 id=h-are-maddie-ziegler-and-chlo-lukasiak-still-friends>Are Maddie Ziegler and Chloé Lukasiak still friends?</h2><p id=par-5_120>“That is so funny that that is one of the questions because they’re actually coming over in a half-hour,” Brooke declared when asked if she was still in contact with her fellow&nbsp;Dance Moms&nbsp;alums. “Yeah, I was gonna say they are gonna be here like any minute,” Paige added in agreement. “Maddie, Chloé, and Nia are coming over. Kendall is in Pittsburgh, I believe, so she can’t make it, unfortunately.” Brooke continued on to share that she felt bonded with her former teammates for life. “It’s like one of those relationships that we can go a year without talking, but yet if I called any one of the moms or the girls they would do anything for me and it’s reciprocated.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_98>It seems that Brooke was telling the truth about original members of Dance Moms being bonded for life. In fact, Chloé recently posted <a href=#>an Instagram photo</a> with her long-time bestie, Nia. “My sister from another mister for life,” she commented on the post. Maddie was quick to comment a sweet message in the comments. “You guysss, ❤️” the Music star gushed. We’re sure fans of Dance Moms are glad to see that Maddie and Chloé (or Claddie as the fandom has dubbed them) are still in contact today. But fans ought not hold their breath for another duet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxorrCnmSmp52oeq6tw52gnmWqnrKouMSrZKCto52ytHnCoaOonV2hwqyt0qKYpGWZo8C1rcarmKZmmKm6rXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./martin-starr-net-worth-career-income.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Martin Starr Net Worth: Career &amp;amp; Income</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kelli-giddish-missed-doing-dangerous-stunts-in-law-order-svu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kelli Giddish Missed Doing Dangerous Stunts in Law &amp;amp; Order SVU</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
