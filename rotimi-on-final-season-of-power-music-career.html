However, as one chapter comes to an end, another will begin,” said Carmi Zlotnik, President of Programming for Starz. “Courtney Kemp and 50 Cent have created a world rich with complex and dynamic characters and there are a number of stories we plan to tell as we continue to explore and expand the ‘Power’ universe.”</p><p>“We will follow some of your beloved ‘Power’ characters beyond the scope of the initial series,” said Courtney A. Kemp, “Power” Executive Producer. “But we will play with your expectations of which characters, where, and the master timeline of it all, creating a ‘Power’ universe as unpredictable as the original.”</p><p>Season 6 will also feature the directorial debut of Jackson with episode 603 as well as the return of Emmy award-winning director Anthony Hemingway (“The People v. OJ Simpson: American Crime Story,” “Underground”), who helmed the first two episodes of the series when it debuted in 2014, to take the reins for the finale.</p><p><strong class=cms__embed-related-story><a class=cms__embed-related-story__link href=#>How Freaknik became synonymous with Atlanta's cultural identity</a></strong></p><p><strong class=cms__embed-related-story><a class=cms__embed-related-story__link href=#>Offset reportedly at recording studio before apparent drive-by shooting</a></strong></p><p><strong class=cms__embed-related-story><a class=cms__embed-related-story__link href=#>‘The Have and The Have Nots’ star Crystal Fox details season 6</a></strong></p><p><strong class=cms__embed-related-story><a class=cms__embed-related-story__link href=#>110,000 attendees expected for MomoCon 2019 in Atlanta</a></strong></p><p>“The last 5 seasons of ‘Power’ have been an incredible ride for me and all of our supportive fans. We are far from over and I am excited to bring you more from the ‘Power’ brand,” said Jackson, “Power” Executive Producer. “I am proud that I was able to put a lasting stamp on this chapter with my directorial debut in an episode that features one of the wildest scenes ever on the show.”</p><p><strong>The A-Scene’s&nbsp;</strong><strong>Francesca Amiker</strong> caught up with <strong>Rotimi</strong>, who reigns in his role as Dre.</p><p>On social media, you may know him as Mr. Sexy Nigerian Butterscotch, but on TV he plays one of the most-hated characters on the show.</p><p>Now actor Rotimi is making waves in the music department with a song and an EP that seems to be taking over the world one challenge at a time.</p><p>What you may not is the talent of the New Jersey native stretching far beyond the big screen. With a music career backed by 50 Cent, T. I, Jamie Foxx and even his mentor Jay-Z, he's now returning to his first love of music.</p><p>“I didn’t do music for a year just to perfect everything on this project. So now, just seeing how well people are receiving it is just worth it,” Rotimi said.</p><p>His newest single, “Love Riddim,” which is heavily influenced by his Nigerian heritage has taken off with people from the U.S to Sweden taking on the #LoveRiddimChallenge .</p><p>The song has even become popular with mogul Shaq!</p><p>“It’s an honor to be one of the greatest at what he does to show love to me, but good music is just going to speak for itself,” Rotimi said.</p><p>But “Power” fans no worries - this is a man who can do both!</p><p>“This season you get to see Dre in the whole new light because you see him as a human being now. See why he makes these decisions that he makes. The love he has for his daughter and it shows the human side of him and why he is the way he is, and people are going to love this season,” Rotimi said.</p><p>While we have a few weeks left for the season premiere of “Power”. In the meantime, you can dance to Rotimi‘s single “Love Riddim” on all music streaming platforms.</p><p>Rotimi’s EP is out May 24!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7cn3ApaCvnV6YvK57wKuropucmnymutOeqa2ZmaO6prrTaKuepJWrtrS1zqdmqaqfnL%2BiudJoq6GdXZZ6tK%2FEp5xoqJ%2BssrN5056YrJ2jYrOqusClZKydkai8r3nRqKuipZliwKmxw6xknZ2klratv45xbGZsYpiDpK6SaWRrcWhlenWAwnBkm5tnZXqmf8Nwa2qakWuCcXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./these-actors-star-in-the-new-scooby-doo-movie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>These Actors Star In The New 'Scooby-Doo' Movie</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./henry-cavill-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Henry Cavill Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
