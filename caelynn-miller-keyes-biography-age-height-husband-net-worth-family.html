Miller-Keyes received widespread attention and praise from the media after the episode aired, with outlets identifying the airing of their conversation as support for the Me Too movement. Miller-Keyes placed fourth in the season, being eliminated by Underwood during the hometown dates portion of the show in the episode aired on February 25, 2019.

She went on to place as the first runner-up in the competition, behind eventual winner <a href=#>Sarah Rose</a> Summers of Nebraska. After finishing her reign, Miller-Keyes was unable to crown her successor due to filming commitments for The Bachelor. Her successor, <a href=#>Cheslie Kryst</a>, was instead crowned by Miss North Carolina Teen USA 2018 Kaaviya Sambasivam.</p><p>Miller-Keyes's pageantry career began at the age of 16, after competing in Miss Virginia Teen USA 2013.
