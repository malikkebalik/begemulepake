You'd go all out, right? Well, that is certainly what <a href=#>David Tepper</a> did when he bought a $43.5 million dollar home in Sagaponack, New York. There's a catch though. The house belonged to his former boss, <a href=# title="Jon Corzine Net Worth">Jon Corzine</a>, the former CEO of Goldman Sacks. Tepper used to work for Corzine and he had an ax&nbsp;to grind. Corzine passed Tepper over for a promotion and Tepper has been carrying a grudge for nearly 20 years. So what did he do?</p><p>Tepper, who bought the house from his former boss's &nbsp;ex-wife, nearly immediately razed it to the ground. In its place, he built an 11,268 square foot mansion that is exactly twice the size of his old&nbsp;boss's former house. If that is not carefully planned and executed revenge, I don't know what is. The new house has an enormous swimming pool and pool house, a three-car garage and a tennis court. It faces the ocean with panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-198267 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-489944293.jpg alt="David Tepper" width=857 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-198267 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Brad Barket/Getty Images)</p><p>Hopefully, the new mansion will ease the angst Tepper has been fueling for decades. His feud with Corzine goes way back to the late 1980s, when Tepper played a critical role in protecting Goldman Sachs from a financial crash. He assumed he would be made a partner in the firm as a result. When he wasn't, he blamed the head of his division, Jon Corzine.</p><p>After that, Tepper quit and founded his own hedge fund, Appaloosa in 1993. A decade later, he was a billionaire in his own right. Tepper is now one of the highest paid hedge fund managers in the U.S. He made a staggering $3.5 billion in 2013 alone.</p><p>Lest you think we've&nbsp;overblown this whole revenge angle, know that after buying the house from his ex-boss's ex-wife in 2010, Tepper told New York Magazine: "You could say there was a little justice in the world."</p><p>In Tepper's case, revenge is a dish best served with an ocean view.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfqrm1tcyaq55loprDprrGnmSboZyhtrC6wKKpnmWglsC0scNmp6unnaTBqrvNZpmusaNis7C%2BzJ6pZpqfqMC0eceapKmsn6PAbrTOrqqeZaSarrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-to-find-them-on-social-media.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where to Find Them on Social Media</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./thandiwe-newton-net-worth-and-how-she-became-famous.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Thandiwe Newton Net Worth and How She Became Famous</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
