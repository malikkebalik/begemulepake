His father left the family at a young age and King's mother, Nellie Ruth, raised Stephen and his adopted brother David alone. The family moved to Wisconsin, Indiana, and Connecticut before finally settling down in Durham, Maine. &nbsp;When King was a child, he was with a friend when he was hit and killed by a train. &nbsp;His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned, speechless and in shock. The family found out about the boy's death later on that day. His mother took a job as a caregiver in a facility for the mentally ill when Stephen was eleven years.</p><p>King was interested in horror from a young age. Growing up he loved to read EC horror comics, which published "Tales from the Crypt." He started writing for fun as a kid. He sold his friends stories based on movies he had seeon. The first story King had published was called "I Was a Teenage Grave Robber."</p><p>Stephen attended Durham Elementary and Lisbon Falls High, in Lisbon Falls, Maine.
