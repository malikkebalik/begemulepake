The newspaper also stated, "For Bruce, losing isn't just a reliable way of make a living, it's his personal philosophy." Strauss has declared that most of his matches weren't done in his own name, having fought (and mostly lost) more than three hundred times in his long career in his estimation.</p><p>In 1997, a movie was released based on his career entitled The Mouse, in which actor <a href=#>John Savage</a> portrayed him. Written and directed by <a href=#>Dan Adams</a>, the comedy-drama film also starred actress Angelica Torn as Mary Lou Strauss, the Mouse's wife. The movie received praise from publications such as The New York Times. Also featuring comedian Rip Torn, the film featured a number of cameo appearances from well-known boxers such as Randall "Tex" Cobb, <a href=#>Ray Mancini</a>, <a href=#>Vito Antuofermo</a>, and <a href=#>Sean O'Grady</a>.</p><p>He once joked that the only reason that he hadn't fought and lost in Antarctica was that he hated being cold. In a 1990 Kayo boxing cards set, he posed while sitting on the canvas, with black make-up covering his eye, as he held on to a ring rope. As stated before, he would sometimes use the alias of "Ruben Bardot" to obtain fights.</p><p>His last official fight was a six-round decision win over Terry Jesmer on November 24, 1989. The match took place in Bismarck, North Dakota inside the city's Civic Center.</p><p>Generally a middleweight using a "colorful" fighting style, Strauss opened his career on June 1, 1976 with a four-round decision win over Gary Maize (also listed as "Gary Maiza") in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He has estimated that he has fought over 300 times over the years, with most matches taking place through using aliases and other forms of subterfuge to get around rules. His long career took him to multiple continents and saw him facing a large group of opponents.</p><p>His career began on June 1, 1976, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, when Strauss debuted as a professional boxer. Outpointing Gary Maize (also listed as 'Gary Maiza') after four rounds, he soon set off on the road. His first official knockout defeat came at the hands of Mauricio Aldana on January 10, 1979, fighting in Las Vegas. Strauss also lost fights by knockout in Africa (Cameroon, South Africa), Europe (France, Germany, and Italy), South America (Peru), and Oceania (Fiji). It is unclear whether he actually lost a fight by knockout in Australia or Asia under the "Ruben Bardot" alias.</p><p>Bruce Strauss (born February 6, 1952 in Omaha, Nebraska) is an American retired boxer who is more known for his losses than for his wins. His nickname is The Mouse or simply Mouse. He achieved notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s after fighting, and generally losing, to a wide variety of opponents, with him also being known for his cheery, easy-going personality. His life was made into the well-received 1997 comedy-drama film The Mouse, in which he was portrayed by actor <a href=#>John Savage</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfl7%2B2r8Rmqq2qkarAtA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jay-demarcus-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jay DeMarcus Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./all-enhypen-members-heights-confirmed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>All ENHYPEN members heights, confirmed</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
