The Eleventh Doctor on BBC’s Doctor Who and Prince Philip in <a href=# rel=noopener>Netflix’s</a> The Crown has brought the 39-year-old actor widespread recognition. His ability is well-known, and he was even nominated for an Emmy in 2018, but we suspect his role in the Game of Thrones prequel will be the defining moment of his career. Who is Matt Smith dating, though, given he has been linked to several models and actresses in the past?</p><p>Whether you’ve known and loved Smith for years or are just starting to know him through House of the Dragon, you may have wondered about the man outside of the show. Now that he’s an internet sensation, people want to know if he’s taken or in a relationship.</p><h2>Who Is Matthew Smith?</h2><p>Actor Matthew Robert Smith was born in England on October 28th, 1982. He is best known for his appearances as<a href=# rel=noopener> Prince Philip</a> in the Netflix series The Crown (2016–2017), for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination, and as the eleventh Doctor in the BBC series Doctor Who (2010–2013).</p><p>When Smith was younger, he wanted to be a professional football player. However, spondylolysis prevented him from ever pursuing that goal. In 2003, he began his career as an actor after participating in the National Youth Theatre and studying drama and creative writing at the University of East Anglia.</p><p>He has since appeared in several plays in London, including Murder in the Cathedral, Fresh Kills, The History Boys, and On the Shore of the Wide World. Since then, he has branched out into the world of West End theatre, making appearances in the stage adaption of Swimming with Sharks alongside Christian Slater and, a year later, playing Henry in That Face, both of which received rave reviews from critics.</p><h2>Matt Smith Early Years</h2><p>Matthew Robert Smith, the son of Lynne and David Smith, was born on October 28, 1982, in Northampton, Northamptonshire. One of the dancers in the viral video for “Call on Me” by Eric Prydz, released in 2004, is his older sister, Laura Jayne. In the past, Smith has been a student at Northampton School for Boys.</p><p>Smith, whose grandfather had played for Notts County, had expected to follow in his footsteps by taking up the sport himself. He had previously played for the youth teams of Northampton Town, Nottingham Forest, and Leicester City, eventually becoming captain of the latter. He could not continue his football career after suffering a significant back injury that led to spondylolysis.</p><h2>Matt Smith’s Career</h2><p>Smith made his television debut in the BBC adaptations of The Ruby in the Smoke and The Shadow in the North, two novels in the Sally Lockhart tetra. His breakthrough role on television was in the BBC drama Party Animals, which followed fictitious parliamentary aides and researchers.</p><p>Smith played Danny Foster, a parliamentary researcher who was a “political nerd” but should have outgrown that role by now. Smith described the persona in an interview in 2007 as being idealistic about politics but cynical in other areas.</p><p>He elaborated on his character’s intellectual and emotional depth, describing him as “wry, caustic, and witty.” Smith paints him as a compassionate romantic who lacks confidence in women but is ultimately a shrewd observer of human nature. The intellectual Danny is shown to be focused and hard-working.</p><h2>Matt Smith’s Personal Life</h2><p>From 2008 to 2009, Smith dated Mayana Moura, a Brazilian actress and singer. From 2010 through 2014, he was romantically involved with model Daisy Lowe. He dated the actress Lily James from 2014 till this year.</p><p>Smith is a considerable atheist and Blackburn Rovers FC fan. He has mentioned Radiohead as an influence and called Oasis “the best rock and roll band in the world.” For his impeccable style, he was recognized as one of GQ’s 50 Best-Dressed British Men of 2015.</p><h2>Who Is Matt Smith Dating?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Matt-Smith-Dating.jpg><p>Smith hasn’t said who he’s dating yet, but rumors have it that he’s seeing a confident Caroline Brady. Unlike Smith, an actor, Brady is a businesswoman; she is the vice president of fundamental equity impact at BlackRock, as reported by Pop Sugar.</p><p>You may recognize Millie Brady’s sister, Caroline Brady, from her roles in shows like The Last Kingdom, The Queen’s Gambit, and Surface. Smith co-starred with Millie Brady in the 2016 film Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, so it’s possible that they met on the set. Therefore, the actress may have been responsible for introducing them.</p><p>If Smith and Brady are dating, they have decided to keep their relationship under wraps.</p><h2>Who Has Matt Smith Dated?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Matt-Smith-Exes.jpg><p>Unlike his suspected romance with Brady, some of Smith’s past flings have been public. The actress Lily James, who recently played <a href=# rel=noopener>Pamela Anderson</a> in the Hulu series Pam & Tommy, was the subject of his most publicized romance. Surprisingly, she also shared screen time with Smith and Brady in the film Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.</p><p>Reports in <a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a> indicate that Smith and James started dating in 2014, broke up in 2019, then got back together in 2020. On more than one occasion, they were caught on camera and captured in red carpet poses together. Mayana Moura and Daisy Lowe were two of Smith’s previous girlfriends before he dated James.</p><p>Smith appears to be a private person because he is not active on social media, but we can’t say we blame his followers for being curious about his love life. Watch House of the Dragon on <a href=# rel=noopener>HBO</a> every Sunday night to see him as Daemon Targaryen in the upcoming week’s episode.</p><p>Keep following <a href=# rel=noopener>venturejolt.com</a> for more updates.
