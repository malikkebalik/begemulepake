Outside of acting, Liza is a successful singer who has released several successful albums.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Liza May Minnelli was born on March 12th of 1946 in Los Angeles, California. Born into a family of entertainers, Liza's mother is the late <a href=# title="Judy Garland Net Worth">Judy Garland</a>. Her father is the late stage and film director Vicente Minnelli. Liza was raised alongside a number of half-siblings and began her film career at the age of three, taking a role in "In the Good Old Summertime." The movie also starred her mother. In 1961, Minnelli moved to New York City to attend high school.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Liza's first professional acting role came at the age of 17 when she took a role in the off-Broadway musical "Best Foot Forward." The next year, she performed alongside her mother at the London Palladium. By the age of 19, she had booked a leading role in the Broadway musical "Flora the Red Menace." She won a Tony Award as a result of this performance.</p><p>While her acting career was blossoming, Minnelli also nurtured her singing career. While still 19, Liza began to sing at nightclubs all over the country. During the 60s, she recorded a number of albums and continued to release more albums throughout the 70s. In 1989, she teamed up with the Pet Shop Boys to record the album "Results." The album charted well. During this period, she was nominated for several Grammys.

These were "Lucky Lady," "New York, New York," and "A Matter of Time." That being said, "New York, New York" featured what would become Liza's signature song. Despite these disappointments, she managed to bounce back with the film "Arthur" in 1981. After these movies Minnelli appeared in fewer film roles. Her sole release of the 90s was "Stepping Out," and after the year 2000 she appeared in just one film: "The Oh in Ohio."</p><p>Outside of film, Minnelli booked a number of notable TV roles. She appeared on a range of variety shows during the 60s, and in 1964 she appeared in her first dramatic role in the series "Mr. Broadway." During the next few years, Liza focused on her film career, but in the 2000s she returned to television with roles in "Arrested Development," "Law & Order: Criminal Intent," and "Drop Dead Diva." Outside of film and television, Liza has continued to appear in high-profile theatrical productions throughout her career, many of which were on Broadway.</p><h2 id=relationships><strong>Relationships</strong></h2><p>Minelli has been married four times; all of which ended in divorce.

There are numerous reasons for these issues, especially when it comes to her drug use.

These celebs would often engage in drug use and go to nightclubs in New York City, where Minnelli would also perform.</p><p>She also became addicted to Valium after her mother passed away, and this sparked a long struggle with prescription drug abuse. In addition, Minnelli is known for her struggle with alcoholism in the past. In 1984, she entered the <a href=# title="Betty Ford Net Worth">Betty Ford</a> Clinic, a treatment center specializing in substance abuse.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2015, Minnelli sold a condo in New York City for just over $8.372 million.
