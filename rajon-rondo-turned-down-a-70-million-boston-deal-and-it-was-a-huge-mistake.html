They wanted to encourage us not to quit, to ignore the naysayers, and to always have faith in ourselves. <a href=# title="Rajon Rondo Net Worth">Rajon Rondo</a> believes in himself. In fact, he&nbsp;believes in himself so much, that when he had the chance to sign a five-year, $70 million deal with the Boston Celtics, he&nbsp;turned it down.</p><p>He was coming to the end of a five-year, $55 million deal, and he thought he deserved a bigger pay bump than a measly $3 million a year. Rondo thought he was worth a max contract, and with his resume, it is not hard to see why.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-173795 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GettyImages-101606990.jpg alt="MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images)" width=900 height=670 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-173795 class=wp-caption-text>MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images)</p><p>During his second year in the league, he was an integral part of the Boston Celtics NBA Championship run. He was named to the first or second all-defensive team from 2009-2012. During the 2012 and 2013 seasons, he led the league in assists, which is certainly a good sign for a point guard, and in the 2010 season, he led the league in steals.</p><p>So in his short time in the league, he has done a lot, and played very well. Rather than pay him, the Celtics opted to go younger and they traded him to Dallas, which should have been a perfect fit for him. <a href=# title="Mark Cuban Net Worth">Mark Cuban</a> had been trying and failing to get a superstar to come to Dallas the last two off-seasons, and has not been shy about paying the guys he wants to keep.</p><p>All he had to do was play like he can play, not do anything stupid, and he was a shoe-in for a max deal after the 2014-15 season. Instead, his production was lackluster, he argued with his coach (never a good idea), and played so bad during a playoff game that the team made up an injury and benched him for the duration of the post season.</p><p>It was painfully clear that Dallas had no interest in resigning him after the season. Roughly a year after being offered $14 million a year, he was going to be out of work and looking for a job.&nbsp;He didn't have to wait long for a job. Dallas renounced their free agent rights to him on July 9, and four days later he signed a one-year deal with the Sacramento Kings for $9.5 million.&nbsp;So, he went from making $12.9 million with a playoff caliber team and being offered $14 million a year to making $9.5 with one of the worst teams in the NBA.</p><p>That five-year, $70 million deal must look really good to him, right about now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjquYo6eeYr%2BwusOoZKCZnZe5prCMm6CgZaSqv6%2Bxw2adoq6VYsamrdFmbmllnZ65rbXOp2SdnZGheqO70q2mp2WcpMC1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sweet-one-south-first-williamsburg-s-tallest-building-tops-out-at-domino-sugar-factory-redevelopm.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sweet!
