Barone</a></strong></span>&nbsp;began to study computer engineering he never imagined that his games to&nbsp;<strong>Harvest Moon</strong>&nbsp;since he was a child would end up becoming a title cataloged by many as the best episode of the saga … even if it does not belong to this one.&nbsp;The arrival of&nbsp;<strong>Stardew Valley</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>&nbsp;is a reward that closes the circle started in&nbsp;<strong>Xbox Live Indie</strong>&nbsp;Games years ago and that, finally, can be enjoyed on all home consoles of the present generation.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-909 data-method=placement-service></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wepublishnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Eric-Barone-Net-Worth1-300x198.jpg><h2>In College</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>In his time in college, he already imagined how to improve the elements of the Marvelous saga, how to make <strong>a virtual farm</strong>&nbsp;that place in which to invest hours and discard all the evil that he had suffered during the day in a relaxed atmosphere. the lonely time, a peaceful environment where it gave the feeling that time was not passing.&nbsp;He alone, disconnected but trapped.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>He himself said in&nbsp;Kotaku&nbsp;that he considered himself a rather lonely guy, that social relationships were not very good for him, but his main form of communication was always more non-verbal.&nbsp;That inability to know how to be part of the society that surrounds him led him to want to develop his own video game, and Stardew Valley is still a response to his own life, to his hobby shared by so many others.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><p>“&nbsp;I think I was&nbsp;<strong>always a lonely guy</strong>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<strong>kind of</strong>&nbsp;like&nbsp;<strong>a hermit</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;But I am self-sufficient,&nbsp;”he said.&nbsp;“&nbsp;<strong>I don’t have many friends</strong>&nbsp;, I don’t go out much.&nbsp;I am an introvert.&nbsp;Art is a way of connecting with other people.&nbsp;<strong>It is for me a way to communicate and to express to others who I really am</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;I think that everyone feels the need to belong or that they can connect with society in some way.&nbsp;My way of doing it is this other&nbsp;”.</p><h2>Time to make it real</h2><p>And this is how what initially began as a hobby ended up becoming his ‘full-time job’, a project in which all the ideas to make a JRPG of management, of agrarian life, were embodied, but without the support of any kind in his native Canada, and without the support of anyone other than his own patience.</p><p>In some interviews, he admits having dedicated&nbsp;<strong>more than ten hours a day to the development of Stardew Valley, even on weekends</strong>.&nbsp;In order to do this, it was supported by&nbsp;<strong>Greenlight</strong> at the beginning of 2013, constant feedback from those who were testing the betas to improve, and outline some details to improve. If something could be inherited from Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon, that had to be absorbed in some way; in the same way, if something did not like about those franchises, it was necessary to prevent it from reaching the playability of the Barone title.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>The media that echoed the title came to consider it as&nbsp;the most anticipated indie&nbsp;of that time, a time when everyone was paying attention to the brand new Sony and Microsoft consoles,&nbsp;<strong>PS4</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Xbox One</strong>, hostile terrain at that time. Then, and&nbsp;<strong>things in life, they ended up being the most ambitious destination in the <span style=color:#00f><a style=color:#00f href=# rel=noopener>game</a></span>, arriving not only in digital format but also in physical format.</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><h3><strong>Stardew Valley</strong></h3><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-170 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>SteamSpy</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Stardew Valley</strong>&nbsp;has sold&nbsp;<strong>about 3 million units</strong>&nbsp;on Steam alone, so nothing that has taken a single dollar per game sold, money will be no longer a problem.&nbsp;At&nbsp;<strong>25 years</strong>&nbsp;of age and without any apparent economic setback thanks to the tremendous success of the game, the future of ConcernedApe, his studio, is glimpsed with more lights than shadows, although there were numerous moments in which everything could have happened. ended up being a mere unfinished story.&nbsp;For him, despite everything, that story can only be concluded by those who give his personal project a chance.<img

class="post-title entry-title">The Story of Eric Barone</h2><p>Eric Barone is the developer of one of the most successful indie games in history, Stardew Valley.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>His journey lasted 5 long years, full of challenges, doubts, and the desire to give up many times.</p><p>But he persevered and despite all the difficulties he managed to complete and publish the game.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Here then I will tell you the story behind this game that has sold over 10 million copies to date.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>The game</h3><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Stardew Valley is a simulation RPG game and was heavily inspired by the&nbsp;<i>Harvest Moon</i> series<i>.</i></p><p>Eric Barone applied several improvements to this game and used it to develop his design and programming skills.</p><p>The consequence of this was a complete and very detailed farm simulation game.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>In this game you inherit your grandfather’s farm and have the opportunity to take care of that farm, planting seeds and taking care of your cattle.</p><p>You can also visit the nearby city and chat with the inhabitants of that city.</p><p>Everything you do improves your character’s energy.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>The journey</h3><p>Eric Barone had a very clear idea, creating a game based on a series of farm simulation games.</p><p>In his view, this series had already lost its way.</p><p>And with a desire to make a better game, he decided to get down to business and make a game on his own, even though he had never made a game before.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>With that, he created a blog where he constantly publicized the progress of his project.</p><p>During this period Eric Barone was working in a theater in Seattle, USA.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>There he earned a part-time income and took night shifts.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>The difficulties</h3><p>Eric Barone never had the desire to become a game developer.</p><p>Graduated in IT, what he really wanted was to have a good job in the field and live his life around it.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><p>But soon after graduating, he pursued several jobs in the field and was never successful.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>It was then that he realized that to be successful in the field, he needed to improve his design and programming skills.</p><p>That’s how he came up with the idea of ​​programming games just for fun.</p><p>He started with a small, very simple game and improved as he grew the game.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>As a result, his design and programming skills were also improved.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>So Eric Barone took a long time to define how the game was going to be.</p><p>He, for example, drew the characters at least 10 times until it got the way he wanted it.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>And as the game grew, a company approached him and asked if he wanted to publish the game.</p><h3>Game launch</h3><p>Eric Barone came up with the idea and although the game was exactly how he wanted it, months before the release he was very insecure, thinking often about giving up or letting it go.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-917 data-method=placement-service></span><p>He was afraid it wouldn’t work out, but talking to his friends he decided to move on.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>The game was then released on February 26, 2016, by <span style=color:#00f><a style=color:#00f href=# rel=noopener>Chucklefish</a></span><span style=color:#00f>,</span> what he and no one expected was the success that this game would have.</p><p>Today the game exceeds 10 million copies sold and has been released over the years for various platforms.</p><h3>What can we learn?</h3><p>As developers, the first thing we need to learn is how Eric Barone saw the market and how he used it to his advantage.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>He saw a series of games with several problems and a solid community.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-918 data-method=placement-service></span><p>These games did not meet 100% what this community wanted and this was Eric Barone’s opportunity to create a better game than the ones that already existed.</p><p>This community was an important factor because, many times, there are very good games that don’t sell almost anything and that’s because there isn’t a community interested in this type of game.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>And the last very important thing was that Eric Barone listened to the community.</p><p>Not only did he apply improvements with the ideas in his head, but he created a blog where he reported all the progress of his game and mostly listened to people’s feedback.</p><p>This made the game meet all the needs of the community interested in this type of game.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-919 data-method=placement-service></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-124 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Publicizing your game before launch was also a crucial step.</p><p>When released, Stardew Valley already had people who knew the game and were interested in playing the game that they themselves helped make.</p><h3><a style=color:#555 href=# title="All posts by Amelia Warner" rel=author>Amelia Warner</a></h3><p class=bio-description>Amelia Warner writes all the
