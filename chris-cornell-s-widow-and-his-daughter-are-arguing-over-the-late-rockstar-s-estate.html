Now, his widow, Vicky, is allegedly denying Chris’ daughter, Lilly, access to a trust set up to pay tuition. To make matters more complicated, Vicky is also battling Susan Silver, Cornell’s first wife over the estimated $20 million estate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Chris Cornell have a will?</h2><p id=par-2_46>Cornell’s most recent will was filed in 2004, shortly after the <a href=#>Soundgarden</a> rocker married Vicky Cornell. According to <a href=#>Alternative Nation</a>, Vicky and the Cornell Family Trust were named beneficiaries of Cornell’s fortune. No stipulation was made for Susan Silver, the mother of Cornell’s eldest child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chris-Cornell-and-Family.jpg><p id=par-3_67>An additional document apparently exists that notes that Lilly will be provided for in the event of Chris’ death. Lilly was still a minor when her father died. While Vicky is currently caring for the two children she shared with the rocker; it appears there is bad blood between Lilly and her stepmother, and it all boils down to how the family money is being handled.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why is Vicky contesting Lilly’s access to educational funds?</h2><p id=par-4_78>According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, Lilly, 19, sent a request to her father’s late estate to receive money for tuition. The estate, which amounts to Vicky Cornel at this point, refused the probate request, claiming Lilly had decided to drop out of school. Apparently, the estate called the California university where Lilly was registered to ensure the youngster was enrolled in classes for the upcoming semester. When the school noted that she was not enrolled, the request was denied.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_48>According to the denial, Lilly’s first and second-semester tuitions were paid out, but the 19-year-old dropped out after the first week of the second semester. The estate is not requesting the tuition money be returned but noted that additional educational expense requests will require proof of enrollment.</p><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-6_57>Lilly took to her Instagram story to explain her side of things. The teen noted that she did not “drop out” as is being reported. Instead, she took a leave of absence from school to attend to her mental health and emotional needs. She noted that she has long felt attacked for the decisions she makes, especially regarding her education.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What stake does Susan Silver believe she has to the late rocker’s estate?</h2><p id=par-7_67>Around the same time that Lilly’s educational requests were denied, Susan Silver came forward to insist she had a stake in the late rocker’s estate. Silver and Cornell were married from 1990 until 2004. Silver believes that there is back child support that she is owed. She also allegedly doesn’t think that Vicky and the <a href=#>Cornell Family Trust</a> should be sole beneficiaries of the family fortune.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chris-Cornell-and-Susan-Silver.jpg><p id=par-8_53>Silver has requested an accounting of the frontman’s assets to determine her share of the estate. She is also seeking an accounting of the estate to decide Lilly’s share. Vicky has spoken publicly about the contentious process, according to <a href=#>Radar</a>, but the two women are trying to settle the matter out of court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwqb7IrGScp6Kjsq240mauopyfrHqiusNmn6KrXZmutrPHrZyrZZGnsm6t0aCsoqaXYry3sdFmq6GdXaGutbGMq6aco6OprrO%2FjJ6qrZmkmnupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./howard-stern-sues-rita-crosby-for-60-million.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Howard Stern Sues Rita Crosby for $60 Million</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-illness-does-he-have-injury-health.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Illness Does He Have?
