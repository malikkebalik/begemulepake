One only has to look at the eyeball party that Kylie Jenner recently had to celebrate her Lasik eye surgery to know that they hardly need an excuse to be festive. Birthdays, in particular, are special occasions and the famous family goes all out for each other and their kids.</p><p id=par-2_96>The KarJenners are known for being over the top. Who could forget when Kylie Jenner <a href=#>rented out a luxury superyacht</a> to ring in her 22nd year? Even in quarantine, <a href=#>the KarJenner clan</a> has found a way to celebrate each other. Recently, for Kourtney Kardashian’s birthday, the family did a drive-by parade to make sure the Poosh owner felt special celebrating her 41st year. It’ll be interesting to see how other KarJenners celebrate if the quarantine doesn’t lift soon. Despite the unknown, we’ve rounded up the birthdays for every Kardashian/Jenner and their kids, complete with years.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kris-jenner-and-caitlyn-jenner>Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner</h2><p id=par-3_88>Momager extraordinaire, Kris Jenner is the matriarchal glue that keeps this chaotic family together. Thus, her kids are always up for celebrating her. Kim Kardashian rented out her childhood home just to host a birthday brunch for her mom. She also rented every single car her mother had throughout her lifetime. It will certainly be hard to top that gift this year. Kris Jenner’s birthday is November 5, 1955. Caitlyn Jenner, on the other hand, has a few years on Kris and was born on October 28, 1949.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kourtney-kardashian-and-kids>Kourtney Kardashian and kids</h2><p id=par-4_74>Kourtney is the only ’70s baby of her siblings, and her birthday is April 18, 1979. The eldest of her kids, Mason Disick, was also born near the end of a decade. Mason’s birthday is December 14, 2009. Penelope Disick, on the other hand, is a Summer baby and her birthday is July 8, 2012. Reign Disick actually shares his older brother’s birthday aside from the year. Reign was born on December 14, 2014.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kim-kardashian>Kim Kardashian</h2><p id=par-5_56>Kardashian West’s birthday is on October 21, 1980. The eldest of the West kids, North West, was born on June 15, 2013. Saint West’s birthday is December 5, 2015. Chicago West was born on January 15, 2018, while baby Psalm West will soon celebrate his very first birthday. Psalm was born on May 9, 2019.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-khloe-kardashian>Khloé Kardashian</h2><p id=par-6_55>Khloé Kardashian, like her niece Penelope, boasts Cancer as her sun sign. The Good American owner was born on June 27, 1984. The Good American owner’s daughter, True Thompson, was the first to celebrate her birthday in quarantine. True’s birthday is April 12, 2018. Their son Tatum was born in July 2022 via surrogate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rob-kardashian>Rob Kardashian</h2><p id=par-7_26>Rounding out Kris Kardashian’s kids is Rob Kardashian. He was born on March 17, 1987. His only daughter, Dream Kardashian, was born on November 10, 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kendall-jenner>Kendall Jenner</h2><p id=par-8_30>The only KarJenner without kids of her own, Kendall Jenner, usually throws herself a joint birthday/Halloween bash. The highest-paid model in the world was born on Nov. 3, 1995.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kylie-jenner>Kylie Jenner</h2><p id=par-9_75>Last but not least is Kylie Jenner. The cosmetics mogul was born in the late ’90s on August 10, 1997. As Kylie goes <a href=#>all out for her daughter’s birthday</a> every year, it’s hard to miss whenever Stormi Webster reaches a new age. Stormi was born on February 1, 2018, and the theme of her birthdays, thus far, have all been about her. Jenner’s second child, son Aire Webster, was born on Feb. 2, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS4or7DmqqhoZGjequxzaecq2WbnrG0ecGiqa2glJbGtHrHraSlZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-was-reckless-in-my-spending-habits.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I Was Reckless in My Spending Habits</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blythe-danner-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blythe Danner Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
