Local townspeople were immediately concerned, as he apparently chose to sell the property to members of the Krishna Consciousness religion. The 220-acre property was sold for $500,000. It features a mansion with 18 rooms and a Greek Revival architectural style.</p><p>In 1993, it was reported that Hamilton had sold a home in Aspen for $2.7 million. The buyer was Tom Figge, the former vice president of Davenport Bank & Trust Co. The original asking price was $3.2 million, but Figge managed to haggle Hamilton down to $2.7 million. The Victorian-style mansion was originally built in 1888, but George remodeled it extensively before selling it. In fact, the actor claimed that he spent over a million dollars on the renovations. The residence features five bedrooms, a wine room, and 3,726 square feet of living space.</p><p>In addition, Hamilton once owned a famous mansion in Beverly Hills called Grayhall. He also previously owned a 3,252-square-foot, two-unit condo in West Hollywood's Sierra Towers, which he sold for $1.55 million in 1999.</p><p>In 2008, George purchased a condo in the Wilshire Corridor region of Los Angeles for $1.1 million. The apartment is located in a luxury high-rise building, and the seller allegedly offered Martin "free cookies for a year" in order to sweeten the deal. The contract apparently stipulated that the actor would be provided with 12 cookies per month over a period of 12 months, from the date of closing. The condo itself features two bedrooms and 1,863 square feet of living space. In 2011, it was reported that George was leasing out this condo for $5,500 per month.</p><p>In 2009, it was reported that Hamilton had sold a home in West Palm Beach for $1.2 million.
