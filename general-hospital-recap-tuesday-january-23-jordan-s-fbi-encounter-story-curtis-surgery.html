Knight), he wasn’t convinced by Lucy’s speech about Scott being in her past.</p><p>After a confrontation in the ladies’ room ended with Martin storming out, Scott showed up and quizzed Lucy next.</p><p>Once Lucy made it clear that her romance with Scott was ancient history, she reminded him that he had a job to do.</p><p>Tracy assured Gregory that her evening with Scott wasn’t what it looked like and ultimately bailed on waiting for her date.</p><p>After Tracy spotted Gregory short of breath and struggling to move, she offered to call an ambulance.</p><p>Gregory refused and objected when Tracy started acting petty over Chase and Brook Lynn’s wedding plans, but he suspected she was just helping him get his energy back.</p><p>Once Gregory was feeling better, Tracy insisted on Yuri (Cyrus Hobbi) coming to pick them up.</p><p>After Lucy realized Tracy was gone, she grumbled about Scott botching things and demanded his credit card.</p><p>Lucy got a florist on the phone and ordered two dozen white roses to be delivered to Tracy from Scott at the Quartermaine mansion.</p><p>At GH, Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) expressed concern to TJ Ashford (Tajh Bellow) since it wasn’t like Jordan Ashford (Tanisha Harper) to go totally MIA.</p><p>TJ grew worried as well, but then Jordan appeared wearing the same clothes from the night before. Jordan downplayed everything and convinced TJ that she was fine, so he got back to work.</p><p>Once Jordan was alone with Anna, she confessed that she was intercepted by a couple of FBI agents while trying to follow a lead on the rifle that shot Curtis Ashford (Donnell Turner).</p><p>Jordan flashed back to being whisked off to a room with a two-way mirror, where she was warned to back off the investigation.</p><p>Someone delivered orders on the other side of a door and put the “fear of God” in the agents, which cut the meeting short.</p><p>The agents apologized for the inconvenience and refused to tell Jordan who they talked to since she was better off staying out of it.</p><p>After a town car came to pick Jordan up, she was advised to stick to her desk at city hall.</p><p>Jordan made it clear there wasn’t a chance that was happening and agreed to accept Anna’s help with her continued investigation.</p><p>In Curtis’ room, he opened up to Marshall Ashford (Robert Gossett) about how he could handle bad news from the doctor, but he’d be gutted if he had to see the disappointed looks on his family members’ faces.</p><p>After Marshall gave Curtis a pep talk, he tried to speak with Stella Henry (Vernee Watson) privately about their spark on Christmas Eve, but she insisted nothing could ever come of it.</p><p>Once Elizabeth Baldwin (Rebecca Herbst) convinced Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton) to attend an NA meeting, he shared with the group and seemed to feel better by unburdening himself.</p><p>Finn expressed his gratitude to Liz once he was done and shared a kiss with her.</p><p>Elizabeth also comforted Portia Robinson (Brook Kerr), who opened up about a recurring dream where Curtis was dancing with her.</p><p>Now Portia had hope of dancing again with Curtis, but she was still nervous about the outcome of the procedure.</p><p>Later, the doctor came to examine Curtis, who was surrounded by Marshall, Portia, TJ, Stella and Trina Robinson (Tabyana Ali).</p><p>Although Curtis couldn’t feel the doctor prick his foot at first, he eventually felt something – and that was good news.</p><p>It wasn’t a guarantee that Curtis would walk again, but it was a nice start and gave Curtis a reason to celebrate with his family.</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say Curtis will hope to keep building on his progress, so stay tuned for more info on his recovery.</p><p>CDL’s the place to be for terrific <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, updates and news, so make us your top GH source.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaW1nl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2apnpuRpXq1wcSsm5qxXZ%2Bur8HAq7BmamNit7C%2Bw5qlrGWWl7Zusc2cpq6mpJq%2Fbr%2FTqKmyZZOqv7W10maqrqqXmr%2B6edKumpydo6h8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-make-white-dye-in-minecraft-materials-crafting-guide-uses.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Make White Dye in Minecraft: Materials, Crafting Guide, Uses</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emma-caulfield-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emma Caulfield Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
