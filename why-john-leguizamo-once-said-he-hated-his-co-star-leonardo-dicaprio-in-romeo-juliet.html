But apart from DiCaprio, talents like John Leguizamo and Claire Danes were among those who greatly benefitted from being in the movie.</p><p id=par-2_24>Although the cast got along well, Leguizamo couldn’t help but reveal why he hated his co-star while they were filming in the beginning.</p><h2 id=h-john-leguizamo-beat-out-benecio-del-toro-for-romeo-juliet-because-del-toro-mumbles>John Leguizamo beat out Benecio Del Toro for ‘Romeo + Juliet’ because Del Toro mumbles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/John-Leguizamo.jpg><p id=par-3_62>Getting a starring role in Romeo + Juliet wasn’t easy for the <a href=#>John Wick actor</a>. Leguizamo had a lot of obstacles, especially since he was still a relatively new actor at the time. For the adaptation, director Baz Luhrmann put Leguizamo through the wringer to make sure he was right for the part. Competing with him was fellow actor Benicio del Toro.</p><p id=par-4_43>“He made us rehearse,” Leguizamo told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AV Club</a>. “About a month of intense rehearsals. Auditions were really brutal. It was between me and Benicio Del Toro for Tybalt, and luckily he mumbles, so I got it. So that was incredible. Thank you, Benicio.”</p><p id=par-5_16>John Leguizamo had nothing but praise for Baz Luhrman, who taught him a lot about filmmaking.</p><p id=par-6_29>“And Baz is just…He’s galvanizing. He makes you feel like you’re so integral to the story and your collaboration is so vital. That taught me so much,” he shared.</p><h2 id=h-why-john-leguizamo-said-he-hated-leonardo-dicaprio-in-romeo-juliet>Why John Leguizamo said he hated Leonardo DiCaprio in ‘Romeo + Juliet’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_46>Leonardo DiCaprio was still a bit of a rising star by the time <a href=#>he filmed Romeo + Juliet</a>. Still, many in the entertainment industry felt that his talent was undeniable. Baz Luhrman was one director who was sold on DiCaprio after giving the star the part.</p><p id=par-8_35>“There was no one else but Leonardo for Romeo,” Luhrman said. “I saw him and basically went, ‘If he can act as well as they say…’ Then I saw him act and he was Romeo.”</p><p id=par-9_32>At the same time, Leguizamo took notice of DiCaprio’s acting talents as well. But unlike Luhrman, who was impressed, Leguizamo quipped that he couldn’t stand how good DiCaprio was in the role.</p><p id=par-10_67>“I just hated Leo,” Leguizamo told Heat (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Press Reader</a>.) “I’d walk in front of the camera, and he would do my line, ‘Thou or I must go!’ all screechy, so then I’d become really self-conscious. It came so easy to that little blond, happy golden boy. He’d smoke a cigarette, do some laps, do a Michael Jackson impersonation, go on the set and there it was.”</p><h2 id=h-john-leguizamo-claimed-claire-danes-and-leonardo-dicaprio-had-crushes-on-each-other-on-set>John Leguizamo claimed Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio had crushes on each other on set</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_46>It’s been speculated that DiCaprio and Danes were <a href=#>taken with each other</a> in Romeo + Juliet. But the natural chemistry between the two was also readily apparent to John Leguizamo. Despite the fights that Danes and DiCaprio had, Leguizamo believed they both shared a common attraction.</p><p id=par-12_37>“I think Leo and Claire had crushes on each other, but they kept it very professional,” Leguizamo continued. “Nothing was ever done. And that’s great, because when you consummate an attraction, you defuse the tension on screen.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3sLTNZqOen6Wex6K5zmaqmqGUYrWiwMSdZKWdn6Ous7DOZpuim5Glv6q7jKumpp2fYre2uMieq2egpKK5cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cardi-b-reveals-the-one-lyric-she-hated-saying-in-the-radio-edit-of-wap.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cardi B Reveals the One Lyric She Hated Saying in the Radio Edit of &amp;quot;WAP&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./was-the-veto-used-in-week-7.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Was the Veto Used in Week 7?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
