Wilton on February 23, 1962, in San Francisco, California. When Michael was 6 years old, his family relocated to Seattle, Washington. Wilton began attending concerts with his father at an early age, and he started playing the bass guitar at the age of 8, learning songs by artists such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, <a href=# title="Jimi Hendrix Net Worth">Jimi Hendrix</a>, and <a href=# title="Bob Dylan Net Worth">Bob Dylan</a>. When Michael was 13, his aunt gave him a nylon string acoustic, which resulted in him accidentally blowing his father's speaker. Wilton later talked his father into giving him a speaker cabinet and Fender Bassman that he inherited from an uncle. While attending Interlake High School, Michael began listening to heavy metal and hard rock and playing guitar, practicing for two hours per day. His guitar teacher said that 16-year-old Wilton "whipped on the guitar," which earned him the nickname "Whip." After buying a fuzzbox and a <a href=# title="Les Paul Net Worth">Les Paul</a> copy, Michael joined several garage bands, such as Joker, with his classmates. In 1979, future Queensr√øche guitarist Chris DeGarmo was briefly a member of Joker. The group disbanded in 1980. After graduating from high school, Wilton studied music theory, gamelan music, jazz improvisation, and classical music at Seattle's Cornish Institute of Allied Arts.</p><h2 id=queensryche><strong>Queensr√øche</strong></h2><p>Michael ran out of money before graduating from the Cornish Institute of Allied Arts, but by that point, he had met drummer <a href=#>Scott Rockenfield</a> and bassist <a href=#>Eddie Jackson</a>.

They started playing at parties under the band name The Mob, and in the summer of 1982, vocalist <a href=#>Geoff Tate</a> recorded a four-song demo with them.

Wilton was part of an all-star youth baseball team that played in Europe, and during a 2016 interview on the "White Line Fever" podcast, he said, "Before I became a musician, I was a jock. I played baseball, I played football, I did all that stuff in school. I was actually pretty good. I played second base and I played third base. I had quick hands and good eyes." Michael revealed that he decided to pursue a music career after attending a Black Sabbath concert, stating, "It happened when I was in high school and I went to the Black Sabbath concert ‚Äì I think it was the Never Say Die Tour, where Van Halen opened for them. I had never seen them live. They opened with a song called 'On Fire' and that moment ‚Äì I think I was a bit hazed at that concert too but it just amplified the surroundings‚Ä¶ when that song started and I saw him on stage, I knew that's what I wanted to do."</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Queensr√øche has earned three Grammy nominations: Best Metal Performance for "I Don't Believe in Love" (1990) and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Rock Song for "Silent Lucidity" (1992).
