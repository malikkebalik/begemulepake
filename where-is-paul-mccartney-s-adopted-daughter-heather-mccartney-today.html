She also became an artist, just like her adoptive father and siblings. Here’s where Heather McCartney is today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Paul-McCartneys-Adopted-Daughter-Heather-1.jpg><h2 id=h-paul-mccartney-s-adopted-daughter-heather-was-born-in-1962-and-he-adopted-her-when-she-was-6>Paul McCartney’s adopted daughter Heather was born in 1962, and he adopted her when she was 6</h2><p id=par-2_47>Heather was born Heather Louise See on Dec. 31, 1962. Her parents, Linda Eastman and Joseph Melville See Jr., didn’t have a great marriage and divorced after only being married for 18 months. In 1969, Linda married Paul, and he decided to adopt the 6-year-old Heather.</p><p id=par-3_49>Heather made a brief yet memorable appearance in Peter Jackson’s <a href=#>The Beatles: Get Back</a>. As The Beatles rehearsed for their new album, Heather sat on everyone’s lap and contributed cuteness. She even gave Yoko Ono a look of disgust as the avant grade artist screamed on a song.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Paul’s adopted daughter Heather became an artist like her family</h2><p id=par-4_48>As she got older, and Paul and Linda gave her three stepsiblings, Mary, Stella, and James, Heather developed a love for art and photography. It wasn’t surprising, considering Heather often accompanied her parents on tours. She was also constantly around as her mother who was a photographer.</p><p id=par-5_39>Heather later went to art college and pursued a career in pottery and ceramics. She released a line of housewares products in 1999 called the Heather McCartney Houseware Collection, which would go well next to Linda’s many cookbooks.</p><p id=par-6_28>Paul’s adopted daughter is still a potter and designer today and has art exhibitions all around the world, including ones in New York, Phoenix, Tokyo, Paris, and Sydney.</p><p id=par-7_16>For the most part, Heather has lived outside of the spotlight, unlike her three siblings.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Heather said her family had been the ‘biggest inspiration’ for her</h2><p id=par-8_25>According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">McCartney family website</a>, Heather said her adopted father has had a “lifelong influence” on her as she “considers [him] to be her father.”</p><p id=par-9_54>Two years after Linda died of breast cancer in 1997, Paul came out to support his adopted daughter at the American launch of her housewares in Atlanta, Georgia. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a> asked Heather what her biggest inspiration had been. She said her parents and her brother and sisters. Paul, who was next to her, smiled.</p><p id=par-10_57>“It’s a family affair,” the former Beatle added. Heather agreed with Paul, “It really is.” Paul explained that he gets slightly nervous for Heather and his other children while supporting them. “It’s easier doing a concert, I think, than doing this. But I’m happy to be here. She’s a lovely girl and I’m very proud of her.”</p><p id=par-11_49>Paul concluded that it had been a challenging time for the family <a href=#>after Linda’s death</a>, but they were moving forward. He said Heather’s homeware line was very “up and vibrate” and that his late wife would’ve liked it. Paul is still cheering on all of his children and grandchildren.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9osHLZqScm5Gnwa%2Bx2KxkmpyfpcGmsIydmK6fmKmys3nHnpitoJWneq6vwpqpraaVrnq1u8OasGegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-ansu-fati-dating-ansu-fati-s-girlfriend-exes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ansu Fati Dating Ansu Fati's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sonja-morgan-mourns-loss-of-ivana-trump-on-instagram.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sonja Morgan Mourns Loss of Ivana Trump on Instagram</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
