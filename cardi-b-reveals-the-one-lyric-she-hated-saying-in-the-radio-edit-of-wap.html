Though the clean version doesn’t include the now known “wet-a** pu**y” lyric, it does have one cringe-worthy word that Cardi B hated saying repeatedly during the recording process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cardi-B-9.jpg><h2>Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion recorded a “clean” version of ‘WAP’</h2><p id=par-2_28>On Aug. 7, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion dropped their highly anticipated song “WAP,” which has since made waves on the internet and the Billboard music charts.</p><p id=par-3_36>The song is all about, well, a “WAP,” which the rappers continuously mention in the track. But in addition to this, “WAP” is also about women giving/ taking in the bedroom and embracing one’s sexuality means.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_47>Like any other song, “WAP” has received its fair share of praise and critiques since its release. While many fans applauded Cardi and Megan for putting out a female-empowered, sex-positive message, others slammed the rappers for making a sexually-explicit song and music video with such vulgar lyrics.</p><p id=par-5_22>Even the “clean” radio edit didn’t sit well with naysayers as provocative lyrics were still said, just in a less explicit way.</p><p id=par-6_34>But despite the “clean” version not including that “wet-a** pu**y” lyric, some consider it to be a nastier version as the name of the inert sexual organ was replaced with a far dirtier descriptor.</p><h2>The radio edit included a word Cardi B couldn’t stand saying</h2><p id=par-7_42>If you were to listen to the clean version of “WAP,” you would notice that Cardi and Megan don’t say “wet-a** pu**y” in the chorus. Instead, the rappers say “wet and gushy,” which some think are much dirtier lyrics than the original.</p><p id=par-8_24>Even Cardi B agrees that “wet and gushy” is a cringe-worthy lyric and revealed she hated saying those words while recording the radio edit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_46>“Ahhh I don’t even like saying it!” she exclaimed during a recent appearance on Australia’s <a href=#>The Kyle & Jackie O Show</a>. “It was really hard for me to clean this song up because nobody could convince me to keep “gushy” cause I hate the word “gushy”!”</p><p id=par-10_24>While on the topic of words she hates, the Grammy winner also shared the two words fans will never hear her say or rap.</p><p id=par-11_26>“I hate the word moist. I hate the word horchata,” she added, noting that though she loves the Mexican beverage, the name still makes her cringe.</p><h2>Cardi B has no shame about what she says on the track</h2><p id=par-12_28>Though both the clean and explicit versions of “WAP” included some pretty racy lyrics, Cardi B defended the song, sharing that she has no regrets about the lyrics.</p><p id=par-13_46>“The people that the song bothers are usually conservatives or really religious people,” she explained to Kyle and Jackie O. “But my thing is…I grew up listening to this type of music. To other people it might be vulgar, but to me, it’s almost really normal.”</p><p id=par-14_30>So even though “wet and gushy” makes her cringe, it seems Cardi B is still proud of all of the work she and Megan Thee Stallion put into the project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwor7DomSbZaKaw6aty6xkraCVYryvsYylsKuhk2LAqbGMoZitnZRiwKLFyKeeZqGeYsGpsYyrmJ2hn2KypbXTZqafZaeWvW%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dennis-murray-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dennis Murray Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-john-leguizamo-once-said-he-hated-his-co-star-leonardo-dicaprio-in-romeo-juliet.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why John Leguizamo Once Said He Hated His Co-Star Leonardo DiCaprio in 'Romeo + Juliet'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
