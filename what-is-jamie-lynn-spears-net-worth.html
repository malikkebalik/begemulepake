In the years since she first rose to prominence, Spears has proven that she has the talent and tenacity to succeed in the entertainment field on her own merits and has starred in several successful projects.</p><p id=par-2_39>Spears has caused some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>controversy</a> over the years, but these days, she tends to keep her private life well under wraps. Still, she is getting set for a big return to acting, one that has her fans very excited.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did Jamie Lynn Spears become famous?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jamie-Lynn-Spears.jpg><p id=par-3_65>Jamie Lynn Spears was born in 1991 and is the younger sister of Britney Spears. She is ten years younger than her famous sister and was a small child when Britney Spears first achieved prominence. Eventually, Jamie Lynn Spears decided that she wanted to pursue a career in entertainment. Her first role was in 2002 when she appeared in the Britney Spears movie project Crossroads.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_57>In 2005, Spears began starring in her very own Nickelodeon TV show, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Zoey 101</a>. The show centered around Spears’ character of Zoey Brooks as she navigated the trials and tribulations of boarding school life. Spears would continue to star on Zoey 101 for the next several years until a major scandal threatened to derail her career forever.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jamie Lynn Spears’ pregnancy shocker</h2><p id=par-5_71>In 2007, Jamie Lynn Spears announced that she was pregnant at the age of 16, sending the tabloids into a tailspin. The news put an end to her Nickelodeon TV series, and Spears mostly retreated from the spotlight to raise her daughter, born in the summer of 2008. While Spears and her then-boyfriend, Casey Aldridge, got engaged and attempted to start their life together, they ultimately ended their relationship in 2010.</p><p id=par-6_23>Spears found love again with businessman Jamie Watson, and the two got married in 2014. They welcomed a daughter in 2018, Spears’ second.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Jamie Lynn Spears’ net worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-7_53>In addition to her acting career, Spears has pursued singing on and off. Around 2011, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee and began working on a career in country music. She has performed at the Grand Ole Opry and has released several popular country music singles, including “How Could I Want More” and “Sleepover.”</p><p id=par-8_72>While her career has definitely experienced its share of stops and starts, fans respect Spears for laying low to raise her children away from the media spotlight. The aspiring actress and singer has been able to maintain a pretty impressive net worth regardless and is reportedly worth around <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$6 million</a>. Her net worth is likely to increase with all of the exciting new projects that she has in the works for 2020.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Spears doing these days?</h2><p id=par-9_71>After a lengthy hiatus from the acting world, in July 2019, it was announced that Spears will be featured in an upcoming Netflix series. The project, titled Sweet Magnolias, will feature Spears playing a young nurse who is attempting to create a new life for herself after some bad breaks in her life. There are also <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rumblings</a> that she will be returning to the Nickelodeon channel in a Zoey 101 reboot.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_52>It seems as though Spears, at the age of 28, is ready to resume her career in earnest and pick right back up where she left off. Considering her popularity when she was a teen star, she could experience a whole new level of fame in the months and years to come.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_14>Stay tuned to Showbiz Cheat Sheet for all the latest Jamie Lynn Spears news.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZZqWuqqxjKWwp6ZdqL2mrdGsZKedpGLEsL7ToWWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zach-nichols-tells-jemmye-carroll-her-late-boyfriend-ryan-knight-would-be-ashamed-of-her.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zach Nichols Tells Jemmye Carroll Her Late Boyfriend Ryan Knight Would Be 'Ashamed' of Her</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-mcgovern-author-at-closer-weekly.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tim McGovern, Author at Closer Weekly</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
