After that, she appeared in the TV movie Pirate Prince. She began to rise to fame after her appearance in the 1994 film Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, in which she played the role of Yvette.</p><p id=par-3_45>Newton landed her first recurring television role when she played the character Makemba ‘Kem’ Likasu on ER from 2003 to 2009. Her other acting roles include appearances in For Colored Girls, Good Deeds, and Line of Duty. Newton joined the Westworld cast in 2016.</p><p id=par-4_24>Newton’s entertainment career extends beyond acting. She also has credits as a producer. She made her debut as a producer with the 2017 documentary Liyana.</p><h2 id=h-thandiwe-newton-s-awards>Thandiwe Newton’s awards</h2><p id=par-5_49>Newton received three awards for her performance in the 2006 film Crash. They include a Critic’s Choice Movie Award, Screen Actor’s Guild Award, and a BAFTA Award. So far, she has also received two awards for her performance in Westworld. They include a Primetime Emmy Award and a Critic’s Choice Television Award.</p><h2 id=h-what-thandiwe-newton-loves-about-her-westworld-character-maeve>What Thandiwe Newton loves about her ‘Westworld’ character, Maeve</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_36>During an interview with CBS This Morning, Newton spoke about her character. When asked by Gail King what she enjoys about playing Maeve Millay, Newton says she likes the fact that Maeve doesn’t choose sides.</p><p id=par-7_65>“What I love about Meave this season is that she has no loyalty to any side,” says Newton. “So, it makes her neutral. Her neutrality, I think, is really important. And from that place, I think it’s better for an audience to really judge how they feel because she’s not on anyone’s side. So, I think that’s a huge strength for the character this season.”</p><p id=par-8_25>When asked by co-host Anthony Mason why Maeve resonates with the audience, Newton says the character’s appeal has a lot to do with her familiarity with betrayal:</p><p>Like so many of us, she has become aware of betrayal. She has become aware of who is pulling her strings. And, how that betrayal, once she’s aware of it, she just rises like a phoenix. And I think a lot of people identify with that. What would they do if they knew the truth? And she does what most of us wish we could do. She’s not someone who leaves a room and says, ‘oh, God, I wish I said that.’ She says it, in the moment.</p><h2 id=h-thandiwe-newton-says-maeve-is-brilliant>Thandiwe Newton says Maeve is ‘brilliant’</h2><p id=par-9_73>It’s clear Newton enjoys every moment of playing her Westworld character. During her CBS interview she gushed about how lucky she is to play such a “brilliant” character. “What a brilliant character,” says Newton. &nbsp;“I get to say those words and be in those situations. Episode 2 this season, I relished every second. [Maeve] is updating herself and learning. She’s a robot, but in life that’s what we do. With the truth, it sets us free, and some.”</p><h2 id=h-what-s-next-for-thandiwe-newton>What’s next for Thandiwe Newton</h2><p id=par-10_19>Newton has two projects in the works.
