That childhood fave is coming back to theaters on July 19 as a "live-action" — but really CGI — film. You may have assumed when you first watched the 1994 original that Simba's home of <a href=# class=T3D>Pride Rock is a real place</a>, but growing up means facing the devastating truth that it's actually not. But while you can't exactly visit them, <a href=# class=T3D>The Lion King's Pride Lands are based on a real African country</a> that inspired the original animators.</p><p>According to articles published by <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Mental Floss</a> and <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Buzzfeed</a>, a now deleted entry on the Disney blog D23 revealed that the animation team behind 1994's Lion King was inspired by Kenya in digitally designing Pride Rock. Co-director Roger Allers reportedly said that the setting was "modeled after many different areas" of that country. He continued, "There are certain things lifted from the landscape around the Samburu District, but we used a variety of inspirations." However, he denied that the iconic jut of Pride Rock, where Simba is first presented, is based on any particular real rock formation. "Many people try to say, 'Pride Rock is based on this mountain here,' but they are wrong," he said. "An artist in Burbank invented Pride Rock."</p><p>According to an interview with Allers and his co-director Rob Minkoff, for Just Love Movies, a few members of the original Lion King production visited Kenya to do research for the film. "We would drive out to the savannah in open-topped vehicles to observe the animals — but there wasn’t much sketching because the animals were far too quick," Allers said. "Instead, we took loads of photographs." You can take a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>similar savannah tour</a> in the Samburu District, which is <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>located north of Nairobi</a> in Central Kenya, if you want to follow in their footsteps.</p><p></p><p>The Samburu District, also called the Samburu County, covers 21,022.27 square kilometers of<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> Central Kenya</a>. "Samburu" means "butterflies" in the Maasai language. While you never see any humans in The Lion King, the district is home to several tribes, including the Samburu. Of course, there are animals that live there too, especially in the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy</a>. National Geographic describes the conservancy as a home to "several thousand elephants" as well as leopards, giraffes, wild dogs, kudus — a type of antelope — and yes, warthogs.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>As you can probably guess, the new Lion King wasn't filmed in Kenya — but it certainly looks convincing. Most of the movie's visuals were created in California using CGI animation. You may have seen some online debates circulating the webregarding whether or not people should actually consider the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>2019 Lion King a live-action film or not</a>. As The Hollywood Reporter explained, films like The Lion King and 2016's The Jungle Book are often <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>called "virtual productions,"</a> as they involve both live-action recordings as well as heavy CGI (computer generated imagery).</p><p>In an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, VFX supervisor Rob Legato explained how <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>an interactive VR set</a> was created for The Lion King. "We're really doing it identically what we did to Jungle Book except much more immersive, much more collaborative, where the crew could now walk into the same environment, experience the same things, and then rub off each other what they like and then it invites a discussion that otherwise you would not have," he said.</p><p></p><p>Because you're watching photorealistic animation throughout the new Lion King, it will definitely seem like the Pride Lands are as real as Kenya. You might never get to stand on the Pride Rock, but at least you know that the African vistas that inspired Simba's home are out there.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jpqpnmWknbJuvNGim55lnJa7pb%2BMmmSrnZGherG4wJycZqyYmnqttc6nZKShnpx6uK3SZq2iq6WWua3FjKKlrKiZp7KlecGyZK2gmah6orLRopqapl2YvLa606uwZmloZ311fJNx</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./armando-manzanero-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Armando Manzanero Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-anthony-mackie-s-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Anthony Mackies net worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
