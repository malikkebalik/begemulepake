Andersen, whose name has not been revealed in the press, had a troubled private life, and at first, her death was ruled an accident. Shortly after, however, Linda’s two daughters, called <strong>Sandra and Beth Andersen</strong> in the media, confessed to the crime.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>Early on, investigators believed Linda was intoxicated when she died. Linda, a single mother, had known alcohol use issues, and lived with depression. Linda’s daughters, Sandra and Beth, reported their mother unresponsive in the tub, and a subsequent autopsy concluded she drowned.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>There was nothing otherwise out of the ordinary in the home, and for a while, it seemed as if Sandra and Beth committed the perfect matricide. According to the sister’s alibi, they were with friends when Linda died, and their mother was already drunk when they left, the sisters said.</p><h2 id=h-a-confession data-injectable=false>A confession</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=527 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>For months after Linda Andersen died, it seemed an open-and-shut case. But around a year later, a friend of Sandra and Beth Andersen reported to the authorities the two teenage girls admitted they did it. Still lacking proof, Ontario police asked the boy to wear a wire to try and get them to confess on tape. In that taped confession, Sandra and Beth said they gave their mother Tylenol 3 before they forcibly drowned her. Some speculate the murder was planned to collect on a life insurance payout, the <a href=#>Toronto Star</a> reported.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>Once arrested, Sandra and Beth were tried as juveniles in Canada and given a 10-year sentence. According to <a href=#>Global News</a>, they have since been released and are no longer under community supervision. If they had been tried as adults, Sandra and Beth could have spent the rest of their lives in prison.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>A history of abuse</h2><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=798 data-injectable=true>In 2020, Sandra Andersen, then 34, talked with Global News about her childhood. According to Sandra, both girls lived with physical and sexual abuse at home, directed toward them and their mother by their mother’s boyfriend. Sandra also believed their mom’s drinking threatened her life anyway. She remembered thinking, “She’s never going to stop drinking. She’s going to die from this. I should just kill her because it was like torture being trapped there” (via Global News).</p><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=false>The story of Sandra and Beth Andersen, known collectively as the “Bathtub Girls,” was told in the 2014 film Perfect Sisters, and the murder of Linda Andersen was covered in the 2008 book The Class Project: How to Kill a Mother. As adults, both sisters have gone on to have careers. Under the Canadian Youth Criminal Justice Act, the two girls’ identities are still concealed. Abigail Breslin and Georgia Henley, who play the sisters in Perfect Sisters, are pictured above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahpmaZopp6tK3NnamaZZGjsW6uxK2fZpmembKzv8SnZK2glWKxosHGoaueqqNixKm7jJ2pqK%2BemrFuwMeeoKtlnaS6brXNZphmmpGptbXBwWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-match-me-abroad-return-for-another-season.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will Match Me Abroad return for another season?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-vampire-diaries-recap-11-11-16-season-8-episode-4-an-eternity-of-misery.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Vampire Diaries Recap 11/11/16: Season 8 Episode 4 An Eternity of Misery</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
