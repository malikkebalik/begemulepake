The rebooted show premieres on April 7. My mom and I just saw an episode of the original series, which we used to watch back in the day, as they’re airing repeats. It was so much fun mocking the terrible interior design of that era and reading into the polite but muted responses of the homeowners. In case you’re not familiar with the show, it involves neighbors swapping homes and redesigning a room for each other, with the help of professionals, over the course of a weekend on a $1,000 budget. The results can vary from amazing to awful. The format of the new show is going to remain the same, except the budget is being upped to $2,000.</p><p>People has an interview with host Paige Davis, who said that she found out that Trading Spaces was coming back at the same time as everyone else heard the news. At that point she insisted on hosting again, which she shouldn’t have had to do. She was the cornerstone of Trading Spaces and she should have been asked to return before they made the announcement! It sounds like that’s all water under the bridge and like everyone is on board to return though.</p><p>The moment that Paige Davis found out Trading Spaces was returning after a decade off the air, the former host sprang into action.</p><p>“On the nightstand I could hear my phone vibrating, like a lot,” she recalls after getting a sudden flurry of social media alerts and text messages last March. “I thought there was an emergency.”</p><p>Instead it was the breaking news that Trading Spaces was returning to television after a 10-year hiatus. “Everybody was asking me if I knew,” she says in this week’s issue of PEOPLE. “I said, ‘I’m hearing about it now, just like you!’” Davis, 48, then immediately called TLC to put her name in the hat. “You know I want to host, right?” she recalls asking. “I didn’t want anyone else to have my part!”</p><p>Luckily, Davis got her wish. She’s reprising her role in the much-anticipated reboot premiering April 7, along with eight members of the original cast and five new faces. When filming picked back up with the old crew, she says it was like the past decade never happened. “It felt like we had never left,” she says. “It just felt like home. I’m so excited; we all are.”</p><p><a href=#>[From People]</a></p><p>Paige looks a lot different without that spiky short hair, but she doesn’t look like she’s aged, right? My favorite designer, Verne Yip, and most of the other designers <a href=#>are returning as well</a>. Do you remember the oldest designer, Frank Bielec, who created some of the ugliest rooms? His style was so chintzy that it stood out. Bielec said some negative things about the show after it ended and his costars didn’t think he would show for the reboot, but <a href=#>he’s coming back too</a>!</p><p>Speaking of Frank, Paige also talked about <a href=#>some of the epic fail rooms</a> on the show. She called them “rare,” which I think was due to people just being exhausted and polite after an entire weekend of working, and said “You just talked them through it, listened to what they had to say, and then go, ‘Bye, Felicia.’” She sounds ruthless behind that sunny persona.</p><p>Here’s a video of some of the worst designs. Paige does talk them through it! The ladies at 1:50 got a living room with straw on the walls and a pink ceiling. That was done by Hildi. <a href=#>Buzzfeed has her worst rooms</a>. I remember her now! She once put furniture on the ceiling and I remember another room where she <a href=#>put newspaper on the walls</a>. She’s coming back too. Here’s a link to <a href=#>more crap designs</a> from that show.<br></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Extended <a href=#>@peopletv</a> video clips from our <a href=#>@people</a> magazine shoot. Full cast.
