Myrla and Gil had many differences in terms of lifestyle and personality, but viewers and experts felt they could bring the best out of each other. Ultimately, Myrla decided otherwise and ended things. In a recent interview, Myrla explained that Gil’s dishonesty about his finances was a major factor.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Just-Married.jpg><h2><strong>Gil was heartbroken over the split and claimes he was blindsided</strong></h2><p id=par-2_59>At the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 13</a> reunion special, Gil shocked the host and viewers when he announced the two were no longer together. He said he sold his belongings and moved into a shared apartment with Myrla for their marriage. But after two weeks, he claims she came home and told him that she didn’t love him and wanted a divorce.</p><p id=par-3_31>In an exclusive interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RealitTV with Bee</a>, Myrla spilled the beans on everything in her first interview post-reunion. In regards to Gil feeling blindsided, she says it’s simply not true.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-4_43>“I was open and honest. Unfortunately, the viewers don’t get to see the entirety of the conversations that we had off-camera,” she said. In the end, she says what the two wanted and where they were in their lives was not the same.</p><p id=par-5_68>“The rest of the conversation that you didn’t get to see with experts and Gil was, ‘Ultimately my emotions showed me that our life aspirations and our values, coupled with a lack of financial stability, were not aligned,’” she explained. “I was in a place where I felt disconnected [and said], ‘I shared my concerns but you shut me down and dismissed my feelings in a disrespectful manner.’”</p><h2><strong>Myrla says Gil was dishonest about his finances</strong></h2><p id=par-6_53>The main subject of contention between Myrla and Gil outside of intimacy was finances. Myrla and Gil both made a good living. Gil is a firefighter and Myrla is a leadership coach. Myrla however likes to splurge on the “finer things” in life, which includes designer clothing and extravagant vacations. Gil did not.</p><p id=par-7_60>On the subject of finances, Myrla said: “I was not willing to compromise on God-fearing or financial stability, meaning someone who knew how to manage their finances and was in a financially similar place as me (healthy savings, investments, retirement, spends within their means),” she explained. “I ideally wanted someone who was in a similar financial position as I was.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-8_33>Unfortunately, she says she discovered that Gil did not reveal everything about his finances until after Decision Day. Gil said on the reunion that he actually earns $100 more per paycheck than Myrla.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_71>“I became aware of some things post-decision day that I was not okay with,” she said. “Gil and I had multiple conversations about this and how it made me feel. He did not see or acknowledge his actions/behavior in a way that was conducive to trust/respect in a marriage. There was some dishonesty I discovered, as well. All of these things led to me making the decision to end the marriage.”</p><h2 id=h-the-mafs-alum-also-says-she-didn-t-like-gil-teasing-her><strong>The ‘MAFS’ alum also says she didn’t like Gil teasing her</strong></h2><p id=par-10_47>Another issue for Myrla was Gil’s constant teasing of her. Though on the show, she appeared OK with them joking with one another, she admits that she was not comfortable with certain comments. Gil often teased her about her being bougie or a princess and high maintenance.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-11_86>“I was trying for this to not be an issue, but it got to a point where it did bother me. Reflecting back, I could have done a better job of telling him to not call me those names more clearly,” she said. “I usually am not bothered by it. However, I was bothered to learn that he was also saying these things to others while I was not present. He did not disclose this to me and as you saw, I never called him names.”</p><p id=par-12_37>She continued: “I can describe behaviors I don’t like, but resorting to name-calling is not something I expected going into this process. It was a new experience for me and an immature way for him to communicate.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6or7RopydZZGpeqe10ayrZquZnLW1ecyyqaWZXZy2rXnSqaOirF2nsqK%2Fzqdkn6GelruksdJnn62lnGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rihanna-wiki-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rihanna Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jose-mourinho-net-worth-books-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jose Mourinho Net Worth: Books &amp;amp; Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
