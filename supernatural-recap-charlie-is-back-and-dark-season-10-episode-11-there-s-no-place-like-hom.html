On tonight’s episode, Charlie returns from Oz and is seen on video beating up a district attorney. Dean suspects she is hunting on her own and that the D.A. must be a demon. When Sam [<span class=itemprop>Jared Padalecki]&nbsp;</span>and Dean [<span class=itemprop>Jensen Ackles]&nbsp;</span>find her, they are shocked to learn the real reason for her return.</p><p>On the last episode, after the massacre at the ranch, Dean (Jensen Ackles), Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Castiel (Misha Collins) doubled their efforts to find a cure for the Mark of Cain but there was nothing in the lore that could help them. Desperate, Castiel came up with an idea that Sam deemed the “single worst idea I’ve ever heard.” Meanwhile, Rowena (guest star Ruth Connell) continued to plot against Crowley (Mark Sheppard), and Castiel tried to mend his relationship with Claire (guest star Kathryn Love Newton) who was plotting revenge against Dean for killing her friend. John Badham directed this episode written by Eugenie Ross-Leming & Brad Buckner. Did you watch the last episode?

Dean (Jensen Ackles) suspects she’s back from Oz and hunting on her own, assuming the district attorney must have been a demon. When they do find Charlie, they are shocked when she tells them why she really came back from Oz. Phil Sgriccia directed this episode written by Robbie Thompson.”</p><p>Tonight’s season 10 episode 11 looks like it is going to be great and you won’t want to miss it, so be sure to tune in for our live coverage of CW’s Supernatural at 9:00 PM EST!&nbsp;While you wait for the recap, check out a sneak peek of tonight’s episode below!</p><p><strong>To</strong><strong>night’s episode begins now – Refresh Page often to get the most current updates!</strong></p><p>A man screams and runs downstairs, chaos breaks loose in his house. He runs outside but trips on his lawn. His hands are tied and he’s got a nose bleed. The house goes silent. Charlie is there and he says he doesn’t know anything else but she says she’s going to torture him anyway. Dean made breakfast and says he’s on a 12 step program to fight off his evil killing urges. Sam says he’s only taken three steps and he tells him to shut up and eat but the food is bad.</p><p>Dean says as soon as his demonic tramp stamp is gone, he’s back on booze and burgers. They dawdle then Sam finds something on Charlie. He shows him video footage of her beating the crap out of a guy – a torture victim. A neighbor kid videoed it. Dean tries to call Charlie but she doesn’t answer. The guy she beat was Peter Harper, a DA and a court stenographer was also attacked. Dean and Sam go to talk to the guy. Dean picks up a knife and his hand shakes. He shoves it in a bag. Sam and Dean talk to Peter and ask what happened.</p><p>He says the crazy bitch was asking him about a drunk driving case from years ago. Sam says – the Middletons. The guy says the case never went to trial and says there’s no record of the case – it’s been wiped off the books and he has no idea what happened to it. He says the only record is the social services file on the girl. He says the cop that worked the accident has also passed away. Sam says the stenographer told them that she didn’t let her go until she gave up a name which was his. Dean gets scary and tells him to talk. He gets scared and says all right.</p><p>Peter says after the files were sealed, he pushed and they offered him a lot of money from overseas accounts. Dean tells him to give the name and Peter says he’ll be disbarred. Dean tells him that will be the least of his worries. He says Councilwoman Barbara Cordry. Sam read the file and says Celeste is Charlie’s real name. Dean says they need to find her before she does something she can’t walk away from. Sam and Dean show up to Barbara Cordry’s house.</p><p>They tell her they have questions about a drunk driving case and she says she has no idea what they’re talking about and asks them to call her assistant. She shuts the door in their faces and they agree she’s guilty of something. They eat lunch in the car. Sam reads off the list of Charlie’s diagnoses but Dean says she’s fine and they were not normal at their age. They hear a scream and run into Cordry’s house. They see Charlie with a knife to the woman’s throat.</p><p>She says – look Rocket and Groot tracked me down. She smacks Barbara in the face. She tells Sam he’s not going to hurt her and says he’s all good guy code. Then she tells Dean that he lets Sam hold him back. Dean says this is not her but she says it’s her all right. She shoves Barbara and goes running. Dean tackles her and she gets him a headlock with her thighs that nearly knocks him out then she kicks him in the head then takes off.</p><p>Sam asks Barbara what Charlie wanted and she says – the bank statements. Dean chases her outside. She slashed their tires and took off. Then Charlie pulls up in her little yellow Gremlin, honks and says – what’s up bitches. She’s all sunshine and light. Dean is stunned. Sam runs out and also looks confused. She says – I should probably explain. Charlie explains there are two of them – one good, one bad and the bad one is a badass.</p><p>She says there was a war in Oz for Emerald City and she made a deal with the wizard to unleash her true darkness to help them win the war. She says they’re connected physically so if you hurt her, you hurt the other. Dean asks why Dark Charlie is out for revenge. She says Dark Charlie won the war single handedly but did some awful things and she told her to go away. She says Dark Charlie is trying to win her back by going after the person that killed her parents.</p><p>Dean says it’s not her it’s a twisted version. Charlie says she wants to lock her away forever but Sam says it’s not the answer. Dean says to take her back to Oz and have the wizard put her back. Charlie shows them the key and says Dark Charlie broke it. Sam says Dark Charlie got the bank statements and will follow them back to whoever it is. Sam hands her a laptop and says to hack into Barbara’s back accounts. Problem is, it’s bad and Good Charlie has no bad left. Sam asks her to tell him how to do it.</p><p>Dean goes to get them some more sodas but he sees booze and his hands shake. Sam is looking at the bank statements and finds Russell Wellington and he’s the guy who likely killed her parents in the accident. Dean slams the laptop closed and tells Charlie she can’t be near the guy. Sam says Dark Charlie is still a part of her. She says he’s right and says let’s go to the bunker and says maybe they can fix the key and go back to Oz.</p><p>Dean says he’s going to go keep an eye on Russell in case Dark Charlie shows up and they remind her that if he hurts Dark Charlie, he hurts Good Charlie. He goes and she asks if he’s okay. Sam says he’ll explain on the way. Dean lurks outside Russell’s office. He sees the guy show up and go inside his office. He follows him in and signs the visitor log. Sam brings Charlie a file on Clive Dillon, a guy who found the key to Oz.</p><p>Dillon retired from the Men of Letters. They agree to try and find him. Dean is sent back as Russell’s last appointment of the day. He’s an architect or builder and asks Dean to describe his dream home. Sam and Charlie get a lead on Dillon and it looks like he’s nearby. They head out. Dean takes up a lot of time and Russell finally says he thinks Dean can only afford a house with wheels. Russell goes to call security and Dean hangs up. He says he’s going to save his life.</p><p>He describes the circumstances of the drunk driving accident. The lights go out and Dean tells Russell not to leave the room. Dean goes out and finds Charlie twirling a knife. He tells her they need talk and she says blah-blah-blah. She says she doesn’t want to hurt him, she just wants to talk. She says this was never about revenge. She says she wants him to see her face and see what he did to her. She offers Dean her knife and says she deserves that.</p><p>She says then they can hand him over to the cops. He takes the knife and says okay. Charlie goes in and he says – Celeste. She says no one has called her that in a long time. He says he’s so sorry. He says he was young and stupid and can never give back what he took from her. He says he was sober for the cover up and that was selfish and wrong and he should pay for it and he will. She says he took everything from her. He says please, I’m so sorry.</p><p>Charlie looks back at Dean who nods. She says – Russell, I forgive you. He sits down crying. She slams the door shut and locks it. Dean tries to get the door open. She stabs him in the heart with a letter opener, breaks the office window and escapes into the night.</p><p>Dean calls Sam and he puts him on speaker. He tells him it’s over and that Bad Charlie killed Russell. Dean tells her he’s sorry but she says it’s not his fault. Sam says they may have a way back to Oz and tells him to meet them at Carter’s house – the name retired Dillon is going under. Instead, Dean is at a bar staring at a drink when Dark Charlie shows up. He tells her she lied to him and she says he lied to himself. She asks what’s off about him.</p><p>He says they’ll both pay for their mistakes. She reminds him that Russell was a monster that got what he deserted. She says being dark sets you free. Sam and Charlie pull up at Carter’s. Sam mentions the Men of Letters and Oz. He plays dumb but they spot the scar on his face. Charlie holds out the broken key. The bartender pours Dean a drink and Dark Charlie stares at her butt. Dean calls her Dark Charlie and he says they’re going to fix the key and send her back to Oz.</p><p>She asks if he thinks she belongs back into Charlie. She says they’ll see about that, won’t we. She says if he’s not going to ask the bartender to dance, then she will and goes off after the hottie. Dean stares at the shot glass as the bartender comes back. He asks if his friend struck out and she says she went out the back. He hears his car crank and realizes Dark Charlie stole his car. He calls Sam and says Dick Charlie hot wired baby and is headed their way even though he told her the wrong town.</p><p>Carter tells them that the only way to repair the key is in Oz and there’s no way to get there. Carter says a coven of witches used the key on him to release his dark self. He says he became the Wizard. She tells him that he’s right by Dorothy’s side running Oz. He tells her there may be a way to summon his dark half here. He pulls out a gun and makes sure it’s loaded. He says if he’s mortally wounded, the wizard will have to come back to save them both.</p><p>Charlie tells him to wait but he says all this is his fault and he needs to do the good thing. Dean pulls up outside and then hears a gunshot. He runs in and then also hears baby. She followed him because she says she figured he’d lie. He tells her she’s not getting anywhere near Charlie and she’ll put him down. Inside, the house begins to shake and a mirror shatters into shards and the masked wizard steps through. He pulls off his mask – his dark self looks decades younger. He asks, what have you done?</p><p>Sam aims a gun at the guy and he magics it away then magically binds him. Charlie gets a pain in her lip and we see outside that Dark Charlie and Dean are brawling. She tells him he hits like a girl. Dark Charlie tells him to let it all out. Inside, Charlie is in pain. The Wizard tells Sam that Charlie wanted to be a hero and heroes die. Dean tells her that she hurt his friend and she says she learned it watching him. The Wizard is choking Sam as Charlie gets the gun and aims it at Carter.</p><p>She tells him she’s sorry and he says he forgives her. She fires and the Wizard is dead along with Carter. Dean has Bad Charlie down and is beating her when Sam stops him. They lay the girls down side by side. Dark Charlie asks if she killed the wizard. She says she knew the magic was in Charlie all the time and calls her Celeste. Sam took the key from the Wizard and places it on Charlie and Dark Charlie is absorbed back into her.</p><p>Sam goes to her and hugs her as she cries. Dean looks down at his bruised and bloodied knuckles from where he was just beating his friend. Sam tells Cass that Dean has calmed down but says they need to find Cain or some other solution. He ends the call as Charlie comes in looking pretty banged up. She says two days of sleep was enough. Her arm is in a sling and she looks awful. She asks about the mark and Sam says he found a book in Tuscany that might help.</p><p>Charlie says she has time to help out since Dorothy is safe now and Dark Charlie is quiet. She says she just has to keep moving forward. Charlie tells Dean she’s going to fix this and won’t let what happened to her happen to him. She says he has something that Cain didn’t. She says he’s a Winchester. She also says she forgives him and he says he doesn’t. He tells her he’s so sorry and hugs her gently. She tells him to prove it.</p><p>Sam tells her to be careful and she says she’ll call when she finds something. She tells him arrivederci bitches as she leaves for Italy. Sam says they can do this and Dean says – let’s get to work. But he stares at his knuckles still bruised from beating his friend.</p><p>THE END!</p><p><strong>PLEAS</strong><strong>E HELP CDL GROW, SHARE on FACEBOOK and TWEET THIS POST!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaG5no6q9pr7NmquuqpGherOxwpqnZmlibH52edKemKynnmJ%2BcXnEqaCsp5SaenJ9jK2fnqqVqHqvu4ypo5qblWK5qrfEZp%2BopZVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-biggest-celebrity-real-estate-deals-of-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Biggest Celebrity Real Estate Deals Of 2022</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-pally-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adam Pally Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
