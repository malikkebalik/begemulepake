According to several of her friends, Amy has been told she won’t be able to obtain a visa unless she can prove she’s clean. And while Amy has supposedly been working hard on curbing her drug addiction, she is certainly not totally clean. Amy was arrested in Norway a few months ago for pot possession. While it sounds like a minor offense, it’s complicated her visa issues, which is why she’ll likely be required to pee in a cup that the government will inspect.</p><p>Amy Winehouse could face drugs tests to prove she’s clean before jetting to the US for the Grammy Awards next month. The troubled singer is being lined up to headline the glitzy ceremony in LA but US officials reportedly want proof she’s sorted herself out before she crosses the pond.</p><p>‘Amy’s been told she needs to pass a drugs test before she can get a visa,’ a pal reveals. ‘She is doing much better and has cut down her drug use but still isn’t clean. Her team are desperate to clean her up as the Grammy’s is such a big deal. But Amy’s not so bothered.’</p><p>The 24-year-old has been nominated for 6 awards including Record Of The Year, Album Of The Year, Song Of The Year, Best New Artist, Best Female Vocal Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Now Magazine</a>]</p><p>Maybe that will be an incentive for her to really clean up her act. It appears that Amy’s been making some good strides in that direction recently. She went on a vacation with her ex-boyfriend (who’s supposedly just her good friend now) while her loser husband Blake Fielder-Civil was stuck in jail. Since her return, Amy hasn’t been visiting him nearly as often as she used to. She’s also been spotted out in public with her father, who’s said to be a big champion of getting her sober – and leaving her husband. And Amy dyed her hair blond… I guess yellow is a more accurate term. It could be interpreted as a desire for change on her part. Several sources have said Amy has dramatically curbed her drug use. And it seems to be true – we haven’t seen her wandering around the streets of London in bloody shoes and no shirt in months. No photos of her buying drugs in the park or sneaking packages through her window. And considering she’s always done those things in the open, either she’s actually gotten sneaky, or she really is improving a bit. She’s a great performer with a ton of talent – it’d be great if she got to perform at the Grammys in a month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcW1obnyiudiYrqKmlZ28tr%2FEmK6ipJyUtaLCxJirqJeglsC0q8OrrKCXpJrAtavBnp2oqpWUvaa%2BxaippqGenKyiwL6gqZqlna7AcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./darius-rucker-of-hootie-and-the-blowfish-is-now-a-sports-agent.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Darius Rucker Of Hootie And The Blowfish Is Now A Sports Agent</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./albert-von-thurn-und-taxis-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Albert von Thurn und Taxis Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
