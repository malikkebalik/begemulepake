But carrying on that legacy can be difficult and dangerous. Perhaps it’s no surprise that Captain Phil Harris, who appeared on the Discovery Channel <a href=#>reality series</a> until his <a href=#>death in 2010</a>, urged his son to give up crabbing.&nbsp;</p><h2>Captain Phil Harris died in 2010&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Phil-Harris-Deadliest-Catch-1.jpg><p id=par-2_45>Deadliest Catch premiered in 2005, and Phil Harris was a breakout star of the show’s early seasons. Viewers were transfixed as they followed him and his crew on the F/V Cornelia Marie out into the treacherous waters of the Bering Sea to hunt for crab.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_48>Fishing is one of the riskiest occupations out there, and the threat of serious injury or even death is ever-present. However, it wasn’t an on-ship accident that ended Harris’s life, but rather a stroke, which took place while filming the sixth <a href=#>season of Deadliest Catch</a> in early 2010.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_60>After collapsing on his boat, Harris was air-lifted to a hospital in Anchorage, where he was in a medically induced coma, according to a report in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>. After coming out of the coma, he initially seemed to be making a good recovery. But on Feb. 9, his health took a turn for the worse, and he died. He was 53.&nbsp;</p><h2>The ‘Deadliest Catch’ captain urged his son Josh Harris to ‘do something better’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_22>In the days between his stroke and his death, Harris was able to talk with many of his friends and loved ones.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_42>“We talked in detail, and he had regrets, and he shared them with me and he probably shared them with his sons,” Harris’s close friend Dan Mittman said. “He accomplished what he needed to get done so he could be at peace.”</p><p id=par-7_31>Phil Harris’s son Josh Harris shed some light on those conversations, revealing that his father urged him to leave the family business behind. (The late captain’s father was also a fisherman.)&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_80>“He told me to get out of fishing,” Josh told People. “I do love fishing, don’t get me wrong, but it was one of those deals where he wanted to see me do something better. He gave me the encouragement. My life goal was to show him I could be a man, you know, and I could fish, and I did the best job that I could, and he recognized that as being a good job and gave me kudos.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-josh-harris-continued-to-appear-on-deadliest-catch>Josh Harris continued to appear on ‘Deadliest Catch’&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Deadliest-Catch-Josh-Harris-Jake-Harris.jpg><p id=par-9_66>Despite his father’s recommendation to leave fishing behind, Josh continued in the family business. He took over the Cornelia Marie after his dad’s death, co-captaining the vessel with Casey McManus. Together, they continued to appear on Deadliest Catch. Josh and Casey also starred in the three-season spinoff Deadliest Catch: Bloodline, which saw the pair head to Hawaii after discovering some of Phil Harris’s old fishing charts.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_20>Josh has admitted that he sometimes questioned his decision to continue in the family business, particularly after his father’s death.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_43>“I resented fishing for quite some time,” he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a> in 2022. “And the money’s different. It’s not the same as it used to be. We have to actually work really hard for everything we’ve got, and there’s no room for air.”</p><p id=par-12_52>While Josh decided to continue fishing after his father’s death, his time on Deadliest Catch has come to an end. He will not appear in the show’s upcoming 19th season. <a href=#>Discovery Channel cut ties</a> with him in 2022 after allegations that he’d sexually assaulted a child more than two decades ago resurfaced.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_15>Deadliest Catch Season 19 premieres Tuesday, April 18 at 8 p.m. ET on Discovery Channel.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_16>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxpq3DpaCeq6RisKLAwqFknJmgqa6quoypn6KkXZ2us77IrGStp5yZerS7zWaenqxdpMK1ecWiqqGhnpx6o7HFqKmeZZSarrW0jaGrpqRf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blue-bloods-recap-10-28-22-season-13-episode-4-life-during-wartime.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blue Bloods Recap 10/28/22: Season 13 Episode 4 Life During Wartime</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./william-fung-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>William Fung Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
