P. Jones. However, the fans still recognize him as a talented child actor. His memorable roles in movies like Big Daddy alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam Sandler</a> and the mega-hit NBC sitcom Friends, where he played Ross’s seven-year-old son Ben, earned him momentous popularity and recognition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by CALL HER DADDY (@callherdaddy)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>Saying so, his very recent confession about losing his virginity has taken social media, especially Twitter by storm. In Wednesday’s podcast episode of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Call Her Daddy</a> with Alex Cooper, Sprouse spilled the beans on his past relationships along with the revelation about losing his virginity at 14 on a family trip to Florida.</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=194 data-injectable=false>It was the same time when the 2005 sitcom The Suite Life of Zack & Cody was on air ,where the 30-year-old actor played the titular Cody Martin. Speaking in detail about the subject, he said:</p><p>“I was on a family trip in Florida, and I met this girl who was older, so that’s already dubious. … The first night we kind of made out, the second night — this makes me nervous, it’s so cringey — I, like, knocked on her hotel door. We were down at the beach on some chaise lounges and I looked at her, my heart was beating, and I finally mustered up the courage to deliver a line that my brother has never, ever let down from me. I looked around and I was like, ‘So, are you DTF?’ She goes, ‘What?’ And I go, ‘You know, down to f**k?’ I was 14. She looked at me and she was like, ‘Sure.'”</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Cole also confessed about calling his brother Dylan that night as he required the room all to himself. “My brother just looks at me and he goes, ‘What the f**k are we supposed to do?’ I looked at him and I said another line that he’s never forgiven me for. I go, ‘I don’t know, go play chess or something,” he reminisced about lying to his brother.</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Moving on to the subject of sex, Sprouse opened up about how it “lasted about 20 seconds” after which he did not remain in touch with the girl.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>Later, he also talked about how the experience led him to take a more sexual approach to his future relationships ending in multiple breakups, and that all his exes would probably view their relationship to have had a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“stronger sexual foundation than an emotional foundation.”</a></p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>Undoubtedly, Twitter users were taken aback by this revelation and didn’t mince words to put forward their opinions on the subject.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>COLE SPROUSE LOST HIS VIRGINITY AT 14?????
