He was best known for his chart-reaching hits of the 1960s and 1970s.

He was only a child when he first started performing in church. In his teens, he became a member of the Triumphs, a Houston-based band that released a number of independent singles without gaining any attention. Their greatest success was the album, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry, released via Pacemaker Records in 1966. It featured a hit cover of the <a href=# title="Hank Williams Net Worth">Hank Williams</a> song "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry." The song was a million selling single. The same year, Thomas left the band and released a self-titled solo album through Scepter Records. This album became an instant hit as well, catapulting to number eight on the pop charts.</p><p>Despite the series of moderate follow-up hits, Thomas failed to reenter the Top Ten until the release of 1968's gold single, "Hooked on a Feeling."
