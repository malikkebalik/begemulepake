A few, however, have risen above the rest for various reasons and have become cult classics. One of these shows is <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a>, a series that has been on the air since 2014 and is still going strong. While viewers love learning about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>new couples that appear</a> on the show, there is still a lot of nostalgia for the original season, and for the couples featured on those first few episodes.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is ’90 Day Fiancé’ about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-2_38>When <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>90 Day Fiancé </a>first debuted in January 2014, the premise was totally original. Created as a docuseries, the show focuses on couples who are recipients of or are in the process of getting a K-1 visa.</p><p id=par-3_49>Therefore, these couples have only ninety days to make all the necessary arrangements to tie the knot. During the course of each season, the featured couples must contend with roadblocks like difficult relatives, friends who are not supportive, culture shock, and problems scheduling the mechanics of the marriage ceremony.</p><p id=par-4_36>Often times, the couples are tasked with proving that their marriage is the real deal, and not a fake. Although they don’t always succeed in convincing skeptical friends and family, they frequently find lasting happiness.</p><p id=par-5_48>The original show has gone on to spawn seven spinoffs, including 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way, 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After, 90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk, and 90 Day Fiancé: Self-Quarantined. For many viewers, however, the original series still stands head and shoulders above the rest.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why do fans love ’90 Day Fiancé’?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_37>90 Day Fiancé is one of the first reality shows to really achieve mainstream success. For diehard fans of the show, it can seem like there was never a time when it wasn’t on the air.</p><p id=par-7_34>Fans of the show love the realism of the series and the way that all the couples face different challenges — challenges that reveal the couples aren’t all that different from “regular” American couples.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_28>The show <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>does have critics</a>. There are those who claim that90 Day Fiancé is fake and that the couples are placed together for the sake of publicity.</p><p id=par-9_61>Still, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>showrunners claim</a> that the couples in the show are very real and that they are already actively in the process of applying for their visa when they audition for the show. Producers of 90 Day Fiancé <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>have also revealed</a> that while the American member of the couple receives payment for their work on the show, the foreign partner does not.&nbsp;</p><h2>Where is the season one cast of ’90 Day Fiancé’ these days?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/90-day-fiance-russ-and-paola.jpg><p id=par-10_31>90 Day Fiancé has had a number of success stories, couples who have really managed to stand the test of time. The first season, in particular, spawned <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>several happy families</a>.</p><p id=par-11_23>Russ and Paola, from the first season of 90 Day Fiancé, now live in Miami and have a baby son named Axel.</p><p id=par-12_20>Kirlyam and Alan, also from the first season, are happily married. Kirlyam has a successful career as an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Instagram influencer</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_37>Mike and Aziza are another couple from season one who has managed to find true happiness together. They have a daughter, and Aziza remains active on social media, sharing their life with fans of the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-14_40>Finally, OG couple Louis and Aya are still peacefully together. Although Aya stays low-key on social media, the two are still married and living in the United States, although they likely visit Aya’s home country of the Philippines on occasion.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_34>Reality shows can often showcase the most dramatic situations and highlight problems within relationships. For these 90 Day Fiancé season one couples, however, their lives these days hold peace, happiness, and lots of love.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSGcXnDmrBmnpmWu6SxjLCfnqqVYra0edKemKynnmJ%2Bbq%2FArKtmpp%2Bse6nAzKVm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./13-interesting-qualities-people-who-everyone-likes-have-in-common.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>13 Interesting Qualities People Who Everyone Likes Have In Common</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-richest-person-on-the-course-at-this-year-s-us-open-will-be-a-caddie-yup-a-caddie.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Richest Person On The Course At This Year's US Open Will Be...
