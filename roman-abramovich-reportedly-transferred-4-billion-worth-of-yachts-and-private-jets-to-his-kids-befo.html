Now, The Guardian reports that Abramovich might have attempted to dodge some of those economic sanctions even before the invasion actually happened, and he reportedly transferred ownership of multiple yachts and private jets totaling some $4 billion in value to his children just three weeks before the war began in late February of last year.</p><p>The changes were made to ten offshore trusts held by Abramovich, seeing his seven children's shared shares in assets, like the $700 million Eclipse superyacht, go from 51 percent to 100 percent. They became public following a hack of MeritServus, a company that's in charge of Abramovich's finances.</p><p>The news comes after an FBI agent claimed back in June of last year Abramovich had transferred two private jets worth a combined $400 million over to his children, a transfer that is reported to have happened just two weeks before the invasion. He also attempted to sell a property in Portugal valued at $10 million but this was halted by authorities due to sanctions that were in place even before the invasion took place.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-342852 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-501982220.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-342852 class=wp-caption-text>Clive Mason/Getty Images</p><p>The transfers reportedly took place just days after various governments threatened to impose sanctions on Russian oligarchs if Russia went through with its threats to invade Ukraine, and it's possible they were carried out in order to avoid such sanctions and asset freezes that could (and ultimately did) come along. And as the Guardian story points out, such moves could be met by countermoves on the part of governments attempting to seize assets that are already ensnared in a complex web of shell companies and other financial entities:</p><p><strong>"The revelations are likely to raise questions about whether Abramovich's children should also be subject to asset freezes. Unlike family members of some of Putin's closest advisers, many families of oligarchs subject to sanctions have avoided restrictions."</strong></p><p>Whether such an effort to seize assets of Abramovich's children could actually happen remains to be seen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfp7yurc1mmJuqkaK8t7XCoWSrnaCkv7Wxw6WwZqyilru0ssSrqZ6cXWl6o7XLpaCopl2svLPAx2amn2WplrCpwNJmmKecXaW%2FqsLArZxmopWpwG7AzmafoqtdoLalv4ybnJ%2Bnopp6s8HSrKCaq12eu7et0qKmp2Wfm3q2t9GaoKedXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stephen-carpenter-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stephen Carpenter Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-40-year-old-ready-to-love-cast-bluu-wikipedia-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet 40 Year Old Ready To Love Cast Bluu: Wikipedia Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
