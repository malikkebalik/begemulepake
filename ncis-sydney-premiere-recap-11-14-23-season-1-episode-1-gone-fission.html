However, a new deal with Australia has ensured that NCIS now has a presence in Sydney as well. The Australian government was in fact welcoming the Americans when everything went wrong.</p><p>There was first a protestor with a large sign that could be seen by everyone. It said “no yanks, no nukes”. They were apparently worried about the nuclear capability of American submarines and warships. And it wasn’t long after the media started to cover the protests that one American sailor passed out before falling into the water.</p><p>The sailor later died under suspicious circumstances. The Australian Federal Police felt his death was their case because they dealt with the larger crime in their own country. AFP Sergeant Jim “JD” Dempsey and his partner AFP Liaison Officer Constable Evie Coope wanted to attend the autopsy.</p><p>They wanted to know the cause of death. They had just gotten to the Medical Examiner’s office when suddenly two NCIS Special Agents showed up. They said the sailor fell off of the USS Navajo and into the water. Thereby making his death landing firmly in American jurisdiction.</p><p>JD disagreed. He also didn’t like the way that NCIS Special Agent Michelle Mackey was treating him. She lacked this little thing called tact. She said this was her case and JD said it was his case.</p><p>They had to go to his boss to figure out whose case it really was. It turns out the case belongs to NCIS. The Australian government doesn’t want to ruffle feathers with the American government. Not when they just made a deal with their military. JD’s boss told him to work with Mackey. He was to work as her Australian liaison team.</p><p>The Americans couldn’t technically investigate the Australians. JD and his team would handle the Australian leg. They would operate under the purview of the NCIS. Mackey and NCIS Special Agent DeShawn Jackson would run things.</p><p>Only Jackson worked more for Mackey than with her. She was bit of a lone wolf. She was also a hothead. She and JD would butt heads quite often. Their partners got on much better. They were at least able to work together to find out that their victim was a bit of a ladies’ man.</p><p>Petty Officer Second Class Eric Flynn was on all the dating apps. He got flirty with a woman who went by the screen name of Xena 27 and they met up the day before he died. The AFP had an intern that was good with computers. She managed to track down the couple to a bar.</p><p>Flynn had gotten into a fight at said bar with a bunch of Australians. They labelled him one of the “sceptics”. It was their euphemism for Yanks. Sceptic Tanks – Yanks. It wasn’t the best word for Americans and NCIS found it really hard to navigate the minefield that was US-Australians relations.</p><p>It wasn’t just one protestor that was against the yanks having a nuclear warship in their country. There was a bunch of them that hated the Americans. AFP Forensic Scientist Bluebird “Blue” Gleeson may just be the intern whose never worked with AFP before, but she learned in under five minutes how to use their facial recognition and she identified the man that beat up Flynn at the bar was Evan Gerber. Gerber was against the yanks bringing in a nuclear ship. And it had looked like he might be right about that when they learned that Flynn didn’t die from his injuries from the fight.</p><p>Flynn died of radiation. The Australians and NCIS both believed that he might have gotten infected because the US Naval ship was leaking radiation.</p><p>It wasn’t long after they revealed this information to their bosses that Flynn’s body was removed from Australian custody. AFP as well as NCIS were told to drop the case. Their countries didn’t want a scandal getting out. Both teams ignored this direct order. They continued to work together to follow Flynn’s movements. They found another American soldier dead.</p><p>He was murdered after being injected with truth serum. Which they only learned when they carried off an off the books autopsy. Their second victim didn’t die of radiation. He was injected with a truth serum. It probably got him talking about the nuclear capability of the submarine.</p><p>That was his department only the Americans in charge wanted to sweep the second murder under the rug. AFP wanted the same. Mackey and JD were told to back off and they chose to ignore orders. They instead lead their team to continue investigating the mysterious deaths.</p><p>They had gotten hair samples from Flynn before his body was moved. He didn’t die from radiation that leaked from the ship. He died from Polonium 210. It was a Russian’ spy’s best friend.</p><p>They took out national enemies with that. Also, it was revealed that Xena 27, or whatever her real name is, was last seen with the second victim before he died. She was most likely a Russian spy used to honey trap the American sailors to get close enough to poison them. And the only reason there could be for why she used something that could be mistaken for a radioactive leak could be because she wanted to be close to the ship.</p><p>NCIS was told that there was a special team there that found out the ship was leaking radiation. Mackey and JD realized that this special team were probably all spies. They took both of their teams to the ship. They got into a shootout with the Russian spies pretending they were cleaning up spilled radiation.</p><p>The Russians tried to take off with what they had and their escape boat was rigged to blow. Someone would rather kill their own spies that let them live long enough to be captured, but the joint task force did at least stop the Russians from getting their hands on American nuclear intelligence.</p><p>And while neither party felt happy that Xena 27 got away seeing as she wasn’t on the boat, they were well-rewarded for their win. They were told they were now going to become a permanent task force operating in Australia. The Australians will carry the guns.</p><p>The Americans will continue to investigate deaths of American sailors. Mackey and JD tried to turn down this promotion because again they felt they couldn’t work together. And so thankfully the orders came from so high up that these two could no longer ignore it without getting fired.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnnpi2tHnSspunnalivbOxzKKcq51dp7Kkrc9maGplYWl6c3%2BMrJyaq5%2BjenJ5xKmgrKeUmnpyecaopZ5llp7AtLXOp2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zachary-henderson-car-accident-23.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zachary Henderson Car Accident: 23</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-nacho-libre-a-true-story.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Nacho Libre a true story?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hot-news-trails-carolina-death-missing-teenager-s-death-linked-to-fall-and-hypothermia.html>[Hot news] Trails Carolina Death: Missing Teenagers Death Linked to Fall and Hypothermia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-best-beaches-in-sri-lanka.html>10 Best Beaches in Sri Lanka</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hong-kong-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html>Hong Kong Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-hard-work-and-perseverance-against-all-odds-turned-diddy-into-a-825-million-media-mogul.html>How Hard Work And Perseverance Against All Odds Turned Diddy Into A $825 Million Media Mogul</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vindicta-1923-louis-feuillade-cast-and-crew.html>Vindicta (1923) - Louis Feuillade | Cast and Crew</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffBlog.
